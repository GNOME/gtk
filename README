General Information
===================

This is GTK+ version 2.0.0. GTK+ is a multi-platform toolkit for
creating graphical user interfaces. Offering a complete set of widgets,
GTK+ is suitable for projects ranging from small one-off projects to
complete application suites.

GTK+ is free software and part of the GNU Project. However, the
licensing terms for GTK+, the GNU LGPL, allow it to be used by all
developers, including those developing proprietary software, without any
license fees or royalties.

GTK+-2.0.0 Specific Notes
=========================

* The default configuration of GTK+ has been stream-lined to reduce
  confusion on the part of new users or users coming from other
  environments.  Users used to older versions of GTK+ may want to make
  some adjustments to the default configuration.

   - Emacs keybindings such as Control-A and Control-E to move to the
     ends of lines are not enabled by default in the editing widgets. To
     turn on Emacs keybindings, add the line:

      gtk-key-theme-name = "Emacs"
   
     To your ~/.gtkrc-2.0

   - Editing of menu accelerators by pressing an accelerator over the
     menu item is disabled by default. To enable, it, add:

      gtk-can-change-accels = 1

     to your ~/.gtkrc-2.0

   - To improve useability for keyboard operation, GTK+ now selects the
     contents of an entry when tabbing into it or when it is focused on
     initial window map. To disable this behavior, add:

      gtk-entry-select-on-focus = 0
 
     to your ~/.gtkrc-2.0

* The GTK+ libraries use an '_' prefix to indicate private symbols that
  must not be used by applications. The intention was not to export
  symbols beginning with prefixes such as _gtk, _gdk, and _pango from
  the libraries at all, but due to a bug in libtool, they are actually
  exported at the moment on some platforms (including Linux). 
  Applications that use these private symbols _will_ break when
  this bug is fixed.

* The Xft library that GTK+ uses to display anti-aliased fonts will
  undergo a major version revision in the next few months. To deal with
  this, by default, GTK+ and Pango are built so that applications will
  not have explicit dependencies on version 1 on Xft. To make sure that
  your application will be binary compatible with future versions of
  GTK+:

    - Do not configure Pango or GTK+ with the --enable-static or
      --enable-explicit otions, since they will cause dependencies on
      Xft version 1.

    - Do not use Xft directly in your applicatons.

* There is a bug in the Xft library in XFree86-4.1 and possibly previous
  versions that causes random crashes when using the Pango Xft
  backend. If you want to use Xft fonts, you should upgrade to
  XFree86-4.2.

* Xft support is not on by default. To turn it on set the environment
  variable GDK_USE_XFT to '1'

   GDK_USE_XFT=1
   export GDK_USE_XFT

* The gdk_pixbuf_xlib library included in the contrib/ directory of GTK+
  is provided on a as-is basis and has not been tested at all. No
  guarantees about the degree of workingness or about future
  compatibility are provided.

* There are known problems with some of the image loaders in the
  gdk-pixbuf library included in GTK+ where corrupted images can cause
  crashes and conceivably worse problems. Until these problems are fixed
  (we hope to have this done for 2.0.1), gdk-pixbuf should not be used
  to load untrusted data.

* The assumption of GLib and GTK+ by default is that filenames on the
  filesystem are encoded in UTF-8 rather than the encoding of the locale;
  The GTK+ developers consider that having filenames whose interpretation
  depends on the current locale is fundamentally a bad idea.

  If you have filenames encoded in the encoding of your locale, then
  you may want to set the G_BROKEN_FILENAMES environment variable:
  
   G_BROKEN_FILENAMES=1
   export G_BROKEN_FILENAMES

  Best integration of GTK+-2.0 with the environment is achieved by 
  using a UTF-8 locale.

How to report bugs
==================

Bugs should be reported to the GNOME bug tracking system.
(http://bugzilla.gnome.org, product gtk+.) You will need to create an
account for yourself.
  
In the bug report please include:
  
* Information about your system. For instance:

   - What operating system and version
   - What version of X
   - For Linux, what version of the C library

  And anything else you think is relevant.

* How to reproduce the bug. 

  If you can reproduce it with the testgtk program that is built in the
  gtk/ subdirectory, that will be most convenient.  Otherwise, please
  include a short test program that exhibits the behavior.  As a last
  resort, you can also provide a pointer to a larger piece of software
  that can be downloaded.

* If the bug was a crash, the exact text that was printed out when the
  crash occured.

* Further information such as stack traces may be useful, but is not
  necessary. If you do send a stack trace, and the error is an X error,
  it will be more useful if the stacktrace is produced running the test
  program with the --sync command line option.

Patches
=======

Patches should also be submitted to bugzilla.gnome.org. If the patch
fixes an existing bug, add the patch as an attachment to that bug
report.

Otherwise, enter a new bug report that describes the patch, and attach
the patch to that bug report.

Bug reports containing patches should include the PATCH keyword in their
keyword fields. If the patch adds to or changes the GTK programming
interface, the API keyword should also be included.
  
Patches should be in unified diff form. (The -u option to GNU diff.)
