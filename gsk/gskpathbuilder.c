/**
 * GskPathBuilder:
 *
 * `GskPathBuilder` is an auxiliary object for constructing
 * `GskPath` objects.
 *
 * A path is constructed like this:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * GskPath *
 * construct_path (void)
 * {
 *   GskPathBuilder *builder;
 *
 *   builder = gsk_path_builder_new ();
 *
 *   // add contours to the path here
 *
 *   return gsk_path_builder_free_to_path (builder);
 * ]|
 *
 * Adding contours to the path can be done in two ways.
 * The easiest option is to use the `gsk_path_builder_add_*` group
 * of functions that add predefined contours to the current path,
 * either common shapes like [method@Gsk.PathBuilder.add_circle]
 * or by adding from other paths like [method@Gsk.PathBuilder.add_path].
 *
 * The `gsk_path_builder_add_*` methods always add complete contours,
 * and do not use or modify the current point.
 *
 * The other option is to define each line and curve manually with
 * the `gsk_path_builder_*_to` group of functions. You start with
 * a call to [method@Gsk.PathBuilder.move_to] to set the starting point
 * and then use multiple calls to any of the drawing functions to
 * move the pen along the plane. Once you are done, you can call
 * [method@Gsk.PathBuilder.close] to close the path by connecting it
 * back with a line to the starting point.
 *
 * This is similar to how paths are drawn in Cairo.
 *
 * Note that `GskPathBuilder` will reduce the degree of added Bézier
 * curves as much as possible, to simplify rendering.
 *
 * Since: 4.14

/**
 * gsk_path_builder_add_segment:
 * @self: a `GskPathBuilder`
 * @path: the `GskPath` to take the segment to
 * @start: the point on @path to start at
 * @end: the point on @path to end at
 *
 * Adds to @self the segment of @path from @start to @end.
 *
 * If @start is equal to or after @end, the path will first add the
 * segment from @start to the end of the path, and then add the segment
 * from the beginning to @end. If the path is closed, these segments
 * will be connected.
 *
 * Note that this method always adds a path with the given start point
 * and end point. To add a closed path, use [method@Gsk.PathBuilder.add_path].
 *
 * Since: 4.14
