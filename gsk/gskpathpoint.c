/**
 * GskPathPoint:
 *
 * `GskPathPoint` is an opaque type representing a point on a path.
 *
 * It can be queried for properties of the path at that point, such as
 * its tangent or its curvature.
 *
 * To obtain a `GskPathPoint`, use [method@Gsk.Path.get_closest_point],
 * [method@Gsk.Path.get_start_point], [method@Gsk.Path.get_end_point]
 * or [method@Gsk.PathMeasure.get_point].
 *
 * Note that `GskPathPoint` structs are meant to be stack-allocated,
 * and don't hold a reference to the path object they are obtained from.
 * It is the callers responsibility to keep a reference to the path
 * as long as the `GskPathPoint` is used.

 * Since: 4.14
