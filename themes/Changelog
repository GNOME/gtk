	* added metal theme, fixed pixmap theme now to use pixmap path - and
          removed lots of annoying print's, added gtkr's for each theme data.. now all
          your rc needs to do is include these rc's.

	* Moved all the themes to install cleanly the engine *.so's in
	  $(exec_prefix)/lib/gtk/themes/engines/ .
	  All the data for themes is now installed in 
	  $(exec_prefix)/share/gtk/themes/theme_name/
	  All things build using GNU configure and autoconf and libtool now.
	  I have created a win95, motif and pixmap theme setup - i have to
	  work on the motif and win95 ones - pixmap theme also need work - 
	  it partially parses a gtkrc for itself. This is goign to be a good
	  sample base to work from if you wish to write your own theme engines.

	* Fixed the win95/motif drawing functions to NOT clobber the original
	  GTK bg pixmap style stuff.... :)
