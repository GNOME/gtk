	* modules/engines/ms-windows/*: Revert most of previous patch, as it didn't work as expected; 
	Some work toward #531086 - the new GtkTooltip widget doesn't theme properly on win32. Now, at least
	the background color seems okay

	* modules/engines/ms-windows/*: MS Windows style should use pango_win32_font_description_from_logfont;
	Allows us to rip out a lot of potentially buggy code, and also get the font specification from the
	XP theme (#434987)
