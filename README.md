GTK â€” The GTK toolkit
=====================

[![Build Status](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/badges/master/build.svg)](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/pipelines)

General information
-------------------

GTK is a multi-platform toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces.
Offering a complete set of widgets, GTK is suitable for projects ranging
from small one-off projects to complete application suites.

GTK is free software and part of the GNU Project. However, the
licensing terms for GTK, the GNU LGPL, allow it to be used by all
developers, including those developing proprietary software, without any
license fees or royalties.

Building and installing
-----------------------

In order to build GTK you will need:

  - [a C99 compatible compiler](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GLib/CompilerRequirements)
  - [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
  - [Meson](http://mesonbuild.com)
  - [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org)

You will also need various dependencies, based on the platform you are
building for:

  - [GLib](https://download.gnome.org/sources/glib)
  - [GdkPixbuf](https://download.gnome.org/sources/gdk-pixbuf)
  - [GObject-Introspection](https://download.gnome.org/sources/gobject-introspection)
  - [Cairo](https://www.cairographics.org)
  - [Pango](https://download.gnome.org/sources/pango)
  - [Epoxy](https://github.com/anholt/libepoxy)
  - [Graphene](https://github.com/ebassi/graphene)
  - [ATK](https://download.gnome.org/sources/atk)
  - [Xkb-common](https://github.com/xkbcommon/libxkbcommon)

If you are building the X11 backend, you will also need:

  - Xlib, and the following X extensions:
    - xrandr
    - xrender
    - xi
    - xext
    - xfixes
    - xcursor
    - xdamage
    - xcomposite
  - [atk-bridge-2.0](https://download.gnome.org/sources/at-spi2-atk)

If you are building the Wayland backend, you will also need:

  - Wayland-client
  - Wayland-protocols
  - Wayland-cursor
  - Wayland-EGL

Once you have all the necessary dependencies, you can build GTK by using
Meson:

```sh
$ meson _build .
$ cd _build
$ ninja
```

You can run the test suite using:

```sh
$ meson test
```

And, finally, you can install GTK using:

```
$ sudo ninja install
```

Complete information about installing GTK+ and related libraries
can be found in the file:

```

```

How to report bugs
------------------

Bugs should be reported on the [issues page](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/issues/new).

In the bug report please include:

* Information about your system. For instance:

   - which version of GTK you are using
   - what operating system and version
   - for Linux, which distribution
   - if you built GTK, the list of options used to configure the build

  And anything else you think is relevant.

* How to reproduce the bug.

  If you can reproduce it with one of the demo applications that are
  built in the demos/ subdirectory, on one of the test programs that
  are built in the tests/ subdirectory, that will be most convenient.
  Otherwise, please include a short test program that exhibits the
  behavior. As a last resort, you can also provide a pointer to a
  larger piece of software that can be downloaded.

* If the bug was a crash, the exact text that was printed out
  when the crash occurred.

* Further information such as stack traces may be useful, but
  is not necessary.
