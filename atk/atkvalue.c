/**
 * SECTION:atkvalue
 * @Short_description: The ATK interface implemented by valuators and
 *  components which display or select a value from a bounded range of
 *  values.
 * @Title:AtkValue
 *
 * #AtkValue should be implemented for components which either display
 * a value from a bounded range, or which allow the user to specify a
 * value from a bounded range, or both. For instance, most sliders and
 * range controls, as well as dials, should have #AtkObject
 * representations which implement #AtkValue on the component's
 * behalf. #AtKValues may be read-only, in which case attempts to
 * alter the value return would fail.
 *
 * <refsect1 id="current-value-text">
 * <title>On the subject of current value text</title>
 * <para>
 * In addition to providing the current value, implementors can
 * optionally provide an end-user-consumable textual description
 * associated with this value. This description should be included
 * when the numeric value fails to convey the full, on-screen
 * representation seen by users.
 * </para>
 *
 * <example>
 * <title>Password strength</title>
 * A password strength meter whose value changes as the user types
 * their new password. Red is used for values less than 4.0, yellow
 * for values between 4.0 and 7.0, and green for values greater than
 * 7.0. In this instance, value text should be provided by the
 * implementor. Appropriate value text would be "weak", "acceptable,"
 * and "strong" respectively.
 * </example>
 *
 * A level bar whose value changes to reflect the battery charge. The
 * color remains the same regardless of the charge and there is no
 * on-screen text reflecting the fullness of the battery. In this
 * case, because the position within the bar is the only indication
 * the user has of the current charge, value text should not be
 * provided by the implementor.
 *
 * <refsect2 id="implementor-notes">
 * <title>Implementor Notes</title>
 * <para>
 * Implementors should bear in mind that assistive technologies will
 * likely prefer the value text provided over the numeric value when
 * presenting a widget's value. As a result, strings not intended for
 * end users should not be exposed in the value text, and strings
 * which are exposed should be localized. In the case of widgets which
 * display value text on screen, for instance through a separate label
 * in close proximity to the value-displaying widget, it is still
 * expected that implementors will expose the value text using the
 * above API.
 * </para>
 *
 * <para>
 * #AtkValue should NOT be implemented for widgets whose displayed
 * value is not reflective of a meaningful amount. For instance, a
 * progress pulse indicator whose value alternates between 0.0 and 1.0
 * to indicate that some process is still taking place should not
 * implement #AtkValue because the current value does not reflect
 * progress towards completion.
 * </para>
 * </refsect2>
 * </refsect1>
 *
 * <refsect1 id="ranges">
 * <title>On the subject of ranges</title>
 * <para>
 * In addition to providing the minimum and maximum values,
 * implementors can optionally provide details about subranges
 * associated with the widget. These details should be provided by the
 * implementor when both of the following are communicated visually to
 * the end user:
 * </para>
 * <itemizedlist>
 *   <listitem>The existence of distinct ranges such as "weak",
 *   "acceptable", and "strong" indicated by color, bar tick marks,
 *   and/or on-screen text.</listitem>
 *   <listitem>Where the current value stands within a given subrange,
 *   for instance illustrating progression from very "weak" towards
 *   nearly "acceptable" through changes in shade and/or position on
 *   the bar within the "weak" subrange.</listitem>
 * </itemizedlist>
 * <para>
 * If both of the above do not apply to the widget, it should be
 * sufficient to expose the numeric value, along with the value text
 * if appropriate, to make the widget accessible.
 * </para>
 *
 * <refsect2 id="ranges-implementor-notes">
 * <title>Implementor Notes</title>
 * <para>
 * If providing subrange details is deemed necessary, all possible
 * values of the widget are expected to fall within one of the
 * subranges defined by the implementor.
 * </para>
 * </refsect2>
 * </refsect1>
 *
 * <refsect1 id="localization">
 * <title>On the subject of localization of end-user-consumable text
 * values</title>
 * <para>
 * Because value text and subrange descriptors are human-consumable,
 * implementors are expected to provide localized strings which can be
 * directly presented to end users via their assistive technology. In
 * order to simplify this for implementors, implementors can use
 * atk_value_type_get_localized_name() with the following
 * already-localized constants for commonly-needed values can be used:
 * </para>
 *
 * <itemizedlist>
 *   <listitem>ATK_VALUE_VERY_WEAK</listitem>
 *   <listitem>ATK_VALUE_WEAK</listitem>
 *   <listitem>ATK_VALUE_ACCEPTABLE</listitem>
 *   <listitem>ATK_VALUE_STRONG</listitem>
 *   <listitem>ATK_VALUE_VERY_STRONG</listitem>
 *   <listitem>ATK_VALUE_VERY_LOW</listitem>

 *   <listitem>ATK_VALUE_SUBOPTIMAL</listitem>
 *   <listitem>ATK_VALUE_OPTIMAL</listitem>
 * </itemizedlist>
 * <para>
 * Proposals for additional constants, along with their use cases,
 * should be submitted to the GNOME Accessibility Team.
 * </para>
 * </refsect1>
 *
 * <refsect1 id="changes">
 * <title>On the subject of changes</title>
 * <para>
 * Note that if there is a textual description associated with the new
 * numeric value, that description should be included regardless of
 * whether or not it has also changed.
