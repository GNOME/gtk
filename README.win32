The Win32 backend in GTK+ is not as stable or correct as the X11 one.

Building GTK+ on Win32
======================

First you obviously need developer packages for the compile-time
dependencies: GDK-Pixbuf, Pango, atk, glib, gettext-runtime, libiconv at least.
See http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/dependencies .

For people compiling GTK+ with Visual C++ 2005 or later, it is
recommended that the same compiler is used for at least GDK-Pixbuf,
Pango, atk and glib so that crashes and errors caused by different CRTs
can be avoided.  The VS 2008 project files and/or VS Makefiles are
either already available or will be available in the next stable release.
Unfortunately compiling with Microsoft's compilers versions 2003 or earlier
is not supported as compiling the latest stable GLib (which *is* required for
building this GTK+ release) requires features from newer compilers
and/or Platform SDKs

After installing the dependencies, there are two ways to build GTK+
for win32.

1) GNU tools, ./configure && make install
-----------------------------------------

This requires you have mingw and MSYS.

Use the configure script, and the resulting Makefiles (which use
libtool and gcc to do the compilation). I use this myself, but it can
be hard to setup correctly.

The full script I run to build GTK+ 2.16 unpacked from a source
distribution is as below. This is from bulding GTK+ 2.16.5. I don't
use any script like this to build the development branch, as I don't
distribute any binaries from development branches.

# This is a shell script that calls functions and scripts from
# tml@iki.fi's personal work envíronment. It is not expected to be
# usable unmodified by others, and is included only for reference.

    PATH=/devel/dist/${ARCH}/$D/bin:$PATH
    [ -d /devel/dist/${ARCH}/$D/lib/pkgconfig ] && PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/devel/dist/${ARCH}/$D/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
done

You should not just copy the above blindly. There are some things in
the script that are very specific to *my* build setup on *my* current
machine. For instance the "latest" command, the "usedev" and
"usemsvs6" shell functions, the /devel/dist folder. The above script
is really just meant for reference, to give an idea. You really need
to understand what things like PKG_CONFIG_PATH are and set them up
properly after installing the dependencies before building GTK+.

As you see above, after running configure, one can just say "make
install", like on Unix. A post-build fix is needed, running
gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders once more to get a correct gdk-pixbuf.loaders
file.

For a 64-bit build you need to remove the gtk/gtk.def file and let it
be regenerated by the makefilery. This is because the 64-bit GTK dll
has a slightly different list of exported function names. This is on
purpose and not a bug. The API is the same at the source level, and
the same #defines of some function names to actually have a _utf8
suffix is used (just to keep the header simpler). But the
corresponding non-suffixed function to maintain ABI stability are not
needed in the 64-bit case (because there are no older EXEs around that
would require such for ABI stability).


2) Microsoft's tools
--------------------

Use the Microsoft compiler, cl and Make, nmake. Say nmake -f
makefile.msc in gdk and gtk. Be prepared to manually edit various
makefile.msc files, and the makefile snippets in build/win32.

There are also VS 2008~2017 solution and project files to build GTK+, which
are maintained by Chun-wei Fan.  They should build GTK+ out of the box,
provided that the afore-mentioned dependencies are installed.  They will
build GDK with the Win32 backend, GTK+ itself (with GAIL/a11y built in),
the GAIL-Util library and the gtk-demo program.  Please also refer to the
README file(s) that reside in build/win32 on how to enable additional features
that are not enabled by default, such as EGL support via libANGLE, which
emulate the GL/EGL calls using Direct3D 9/11.

Please refer to the following GNOME Live! page for a more detailed ouline
on the process of building the GTK+ stack and its dependencies with Visual
C++:

https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GTK+/Win32/MSVCCompilationOfGTKStack

Alternative 1 also generates Microsoft import libraries (.lib), if you
have lib.exe available. It might also work for cross-compilation from
Unix.

I (Tor) use method 1 myself. Hans Breuer has been taking care of the MSVC
makefiles. At times, we disagree a bit about various issues, and for
instance the makefile.msc files might not produce identically named
DLLs and import libraries as the "autoconfiscated" makefiles and
libtool do. If this bothers you, you will have to fix the makefiles.

3) Using Meson (for Visual Studio and MinGW builds)
---

Meson can now be used to build GTK+-3.x with either MinGW or Visual Studio.
You will need the following items in addition to all the dependencies
listed above:

- Python 3.5 or later
- Meson build system, 0.48.0 or later
- Ninja (if not using the Visual Studio project generator for
         Visual Studio 2010, 2015, 2017, 2019)
- CMake (optional, used for dependency searching)
- pkg-config (optional, or some compatible tool, highly recommended)

For all Windows builds, note that unless -Dbuiltin_immodules=no is specified,
the input modules (immodules) are built directly into the GTK DLL.

For building with Meson using Visual Studio, do the following:

Create an empty build directory somewhere that is on the same drive
as the source tree, and launch the Visual Studio command prompt that
matches the build configuration (Visual Studio version and architecture),
and run the following:

- Ensure that both the installation directory of Python and its script
  directory is in your PATH, as well as the Ninja, CMake and pkg-config
  executables (if used).  If a pkg-config compatible drop-in replacement
  tool is being used, ensure that PKG_CONFIG is set to point to the
  executable of that tool as well.

- For non-GNOME dependencies (such as Cairo and Harfbuzz), where pkg-config
  files or CMake files could not be properly located, set INCLUDE and LIB
  to ensure that their header files and .lib files can be found respectively.
  The DLLs of those dependencies should also be in the PATH during the build
  as well, especially if introspection files are to be built.

- For GNOME dependencies, the pkg-config files for those dependencies should
  be searchable by pkg-config (or a compatible tool).  Verify this by running
  $(PKG_CONFIG) --modversion <dependency>.

- Run the following:
  meson <path_to_directory_of_this_file> --buildtype=... --prefix=...,
  where buildtype can be release, debugoptimized, debug or plain.  Please
  refer to the Meson documentation for more details.  You may also wish to
  pass in -Dbroadway_backend=true if building the Broadway GDK backend is
  desired, and/or pass in -Dbuiltin_immodules=no to build the immodules as
  standalone DLLs that can be loaded by GTK dynamically.  For Visual Studio
  2010, 2015, 2017 and 2019 builds, you may pass in --backend=vs to generate
  Visual Studio project files to be used to carry out the builds.

If you are building with Visual Studio 2008, note the following items as well:

- For x64 builds, the compiler may hang when building the certain files, due
  to optimization issues in the compiler.  If this happens, use the Windows
  Task Manager and terminate all cl.exe processes, and the build will fail
  with the source files that did not finish compiling due to the hang.
  Look for them in build.ninja in the build directory, and change their compiler
  flag "/O2" to "/O1", and the compilation and linking should proceed normally.
  At this time of writing, the following files are known to cause this hang:

    gtk\gtkfilechoosernativewin32.c
    gtk\gtkfilesystemmodel.c
    gtk\gtktextsegment.c
    gtk\gtktextbtree.c
    gtk\gtkrbtree.c
    testsuite\gtk\treemodel.c
    testsuite\gtk\textbuffer.c
    testsuite\gtk\rbtree.c
    testsuite\gtk\icontheme.c

- Upon running install (via "ninja install"), it is likely that
  gtk-query-immodules-3.0.exe will fail to run as it cannot find msvcr90.dll or
  msvcr90D.dll.  You can ignore this if you did not specify -Dbuiltin_immodules=no
  when configuring via Meson.  If -Dbuiltin_immodules=no is specified, you need to
  run the following after   embedding the manifests as outlined in the next point:

    <gtk_install_prefix>\bin\gtk-query-immodules-3.0.exe > <gtk_install_prefix>\lib\gtk-3.0\3.0.0\immodules.cache

- You will need to run the following upon completing install, from the build
  directory in the Visual Studio 2008/SDK 6.0 command prompt (third line is not
  needed unless -Dbuiltin_immodules=no is specified) so that the built binaries
  can run:

    for /r %f in (*.dll.manifest) do if exist <gtk_install_prefix>\bin\%~nf mt /manifest %f /outputresource:<gtk_install_prefix>\bin\%~nf;2
    for /r %f in (*.exe.manifest) do if exist <gtk_install_prefix>\bin\%~nf mt /manifest %f /outputresource:<gtk_install_prefix>\bin\%~nf;1
    for /r %f in (*.dll.manifest) do if exist <gtk_install_prefix>\lib\gtk-3.0\3.0.0\immodules\%~nf mt /manifest %f /outputresource:<gtk_install_prefix>\lib\gtk-3.0\3.0.0\immodules\%~nf;2

- The more modern visual style for the print dialog is not applied for Visual
  Studio 2008 builds.  Any solutions to this is really appreciated.

Using GTK+ on Win32
===================

To use GTK+ on Win32, you also need either one of the above mentioned
compilers. Other compilers might work, but don't count on it. Look for
prebuilt developer packages (DLLs, import libraries, headers) on the
above website.

Multi-threaded use of GTK+ on Win32
===================================

Multi-threaded GTK+ programs might work on Windows in special simple
cases, but not in general. Sorry. If you have all GTK+ and GDK calls
in the same thread, it might work. Otherwise, probably not at
all. Possible ways to fix this are being investigated.

Wintab
======

The tablet support uses the Wintab API. The Wintab development kit is
no longer required. The wintab.h header file is bundled with GTK+
sources. Unfortunately it seems that only Wacom tablets come with
support for the Wintab API nowadays.
