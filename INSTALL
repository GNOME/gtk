Prerequisites
=============

GTK+ requires the following packages:

 - The GLib, Pango, ATK and cairo libraries, available at the same 
   location as GTK+. GTK+ 2.16.0 requires at least GLib 2.17.6,
   Pango 1.20, ATK 1.13.0 and cairo 1.6.0.

 - The TIFF, PNG, and JPEG image loading libraries. You most
   likely have these installed on your system already. If not
   these libraries are available from:

    http://www.libtiff.org/
    http://www.libpng.org/
    http://www.ijg.org/

    libtiff must be version 3.6.0 or higher.

Simple install procedure
========================

  % gzip -cd gtk+-2.16.0.tar.gz | tar xvf - # unpack the sources
  % cd gtk+-2.16.0			   # change to the toplevel directory
  % ./configure				   # run the `configure' script
  % make				   # build GTK+
  [ Become root if necessary ]
  % make install			   # install GTK+
