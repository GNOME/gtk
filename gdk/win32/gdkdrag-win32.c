/*
 * Support for OLE-2 drag and drop added at Archaeopteryx Software, 2001
 * For more information, do not contact Stephan R.A. Deibel (sdeibel@archaeopteryx.com),
 * because the code went through multiple modifications since then.
 *
 * Notes on the implementation:
 *
 * Source drag context, IDropSource and IDataObject for it are created
 * (almost) simultaneously, whereas target drag context and IDropTarget
 * are separated in time - IDropTarget is created when a window is made
 * to accept drops, while target drag context is created when a dragging
 * cursor enters the window and is destroyed when that cursor leaves
 * the window.
 *
 * There's a mismatch between data types supported by W32 (W32 formats)
 * and by GTK (GDK contentformats).
 * To account for it the data is transmuted back and forth. There are two
 * main points of transmutation:
 * * GdkWin32HDATAOutputStream: transmutes GTK data to W32 data
 * * GdkWin32Drop: transmutes W32 data to GTK data
 *
 * There are also two points where data formats are considered:
 * * When source drag context is created, it gets a list of GDK contentformats
 *   that it supports, these are matched to the W32 formats they
 *   correspond to (possibly with transmutation). New W32 formats for
 *   GTK-specific contentformats are also created here (see below).
 * * When target drop context is created, it queries the IDataObject
 *   for the list of W32 formats it supports and matches these to
 *   corresponding GDK contentformats that it will be able to provide
 *   (possibly with transmutation) later. Missing GDK contentformats for
 *   W32-specific formats are also created here (see below).
 *
 * W32 formats are integers (CLIPFORMAT), while GTK contentformats
 * are mime/type strings, and cannot be used interchangeably.
 *
 * To accommodate advanced GTK applications the code allows them to
 * register drop targets that accept W32 data formats, and to register
 * drag sources that provide W32 data formats. To do that they must
 * register with the mime/type "application/x.windows.ZZZ", where
 * ZZZ is the string name of the format in question
 * (for example, "Shell IDList Array") or, for unnamed pre-defined
 * formats, register with the stringified constant name of the format
 * in question (for example, "CF_UNICODETEXT").
 * If such contentformat is accepted/provided, GDK will not try to
 * transmute it to/from something else. Otherwise GDK will do the following
 * transmutation:
 * * If GTK application provides image/png, image/gif or image/jpeg,
 *   GDK will claim to also provide "PNG", "GIF" or "JFIF" respectively,
 *   and will pass these along verbatim.
 * * If GTK application provides any GdkPixbuf-compatible contentformat,
 *   GDK will also offer "PNG" and CF_DIB W32 formats.
 * * If GTK application provides text/plain;charset=utf8, GDK will also offer
 *   CF_UNICODETEXT (UTF-16-encoded) and CF_TEXT (encoded with thread-
 *   and locale-dependent codepage), and will do the conversion when such
 *   data is requested.
 * * If GTK application accepts image/png, image/gif or image/jpeg,
 *   GDK will claim to also accept "PNG", "GIF" or "JFIF" respectively,
 *   and will pass these along verbatim.
 * * If GTK application accepts image/bmp, GDK will
 *   claim to accept CF_DIB W32 format, and will convert
 *   it, changing the header, when such data is provided.
 * * If GTK application accepts text/plain;charset=utf8, GDK will
 *   claim to accept CF_UNICODETEXT and CF_TEXT, and will do
 *   the conversion when such data is provided.
 * * If GTK application accepts text/uri-list, GDK will
 *   claim to accept "Shell IDList Array", and will do the
 *   conversion when such data is provided.
 *
 * Currently the conversion from text/uri-list to "Shell IDList Array" is not
 * implemented, so it's not possible to drag & drop files from GTK
 * applications to non-GTK applications the same way one can drag files
 * from Windows Explorer.
 *
 * To increase inter-GTK compatibility, GDK will register GTK-specific
 * formats by their mime/types, as-is (i.e "text/plain;charset=utf-8", for example).
 * That way two GTK applications can exchange data in their native formats
 * (both well-known ones, such as text/plain;charset=utf8, and special,
 * known only to specific applications). This will work just
 * fine as long as both applications agree on what kind of data is stored
 * under such format exactly.
 *
 * Note that clipboard format space is limited, there can only be 16384
 * of them for a particular user session. Therefore it is highly inadvisable
 * to create and register such formats out of the whole cloth, dynamically.
 * If more flexibility is needed, register one format that has some
 * internal indicators of the kind of data it contains, then write the application
 * in such a way that it requests the data and inspects its header before deciding
 * whether to accept it or not. For details see GTK drag & drop documentation
 * on the "drag-motion" and "drag-data-received" signals.
 *
 * How managed DnD works:
 * GTK widget detects a drag gesture and calls
 * S: gdk_drag_begin_from_point() -> backend:drag_begin()
 * which creates the source drag context and the drag window,
 * and grabs the pointing device. GDK layer adds the context
 * to a list of currently-active contexts.
 *
 * From that point forward the context gets any events emitted
 * by GDK, and can prevent these events from going anywhere else.
 * They are all handled in
 * S: gdk_drag_handle_source_event() -> backend:handle_event()
 * (except for wayland backend - it doesn't have that function).
 *
 * That function catches the following events:
 * GDK_MOTION_NOTIFY
 * GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE
 * GDK_KEY_PRESS
 * GDK_KEY_RELEASE
 * GDK_GRAB_BROKEN
 *
 * GDK_MOTION_NOTIFY is emitted by the backend in response to
 * mouse movement.
 * Drag context handles it by calling a bunch of functions to
 * determine the state of the drag actions from the keys being
 * pressed, finding the drag window (another backend function
 * routed through GDK layer) and finally calls
 * S: gdk_drag_motion -> backend:drag_motion()
 * to notify the backend (i.e. itself) that the drag cursor
 * moved.
 * The response to that is to move the drag window and
 * do various bookkeeping.
 * W32: OLE2 protocol does nothing (other than moving the
 * drag window) in response to this, as all the functions
 * that GDK could perform here are already handled by the
 * OS driving the DnD process via DoDragDrop() call.
 *
 * GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE checks the
 * released button - if it's the button that was used to
 * initiate the drag, the "drop-performed" signal is emitted,
 * otherwise the drag is cancelled.
 *
 * GDK_KEY_PRESS and GDK_KEY_RELEASE handler does exactly the same thing as
 * GDK_MOTION_NOTIFY handler, but only after it checks the pressed
 * keys to emit "drop-performed" signal (on Space, Enter etc),
 * cancel the drag (on Escape) or move the drag cursor (arrow keys).
 *
 * GDK_GRAB_BROKEN handler cancels the drag for most broken grabs
 * (except for some special cases where the backend itself does
 *  temporary grabs as part of DnD, such as changing the cursor).
 *
 * GDK_DRAG_ENTER, GDK_DRAG_LEAVE, GDK_DRAG_MOTION and GDK_DROP_START
 * events are emitted when
 * the OS notifies the process about these things happening.
 * For X11 backend that is done in Xdnd event filters,
 * for W32 backend this is done in IDropSource/IDropTarget
 * object methods for the OLE2 protocol.
