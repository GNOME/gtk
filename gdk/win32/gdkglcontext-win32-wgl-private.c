 * These wrapper functions are used when we don't want to use the wgl*() core functions
 * that we acquire via libepoxy (such as when we are disposing the Gdk(W)GLContext from,
 * different threads, so for these calls, we are actually linking to the system's/ICD
 * opengl32.dll directly, so that we are guaranteed that the "right" versions of these
 * WGL calls are carried out.  This must be a separate source file because we can't include
 * the system's GL/gl.h with epoxy/(w)gl.h together in a single source file.  We should not
 * need to use these when we are creating/initializing a WGL context in GDK, since we should
 * be in the same thread at this point.
