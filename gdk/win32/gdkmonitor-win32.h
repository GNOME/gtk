/*
 * The number is the degrees the display is rotated clockwise
 * from its natural position.
 * I.e. most displays will have 0. A normal display
 * that is rotated by 90 degrees will
 * have 90. The same display rotated counter-clockwise
 * will have 270. The same display
 * rotated by 180 degrees (i.e. upside-down)
 * will have 180.
 * Accordingly, 0 mode
 * fontsmoothing is used as-is - i.e. it is assumed that
 * subpixel structure is horizontal (ClearType does not support
 * vertical subpixels; if the display has naturally vertical
 * subpixel structure, ClearType should be disabled altogether).
 * In 90 subpixel structure has
 * its verticality flipped (rgb -> vrgb; bgr -> vbgr).
 * In 180 subpixel structure is
 * horizontally flipped (rgb -> bgr; bgr -> rgb).
 * In 270 subpixel structure is
 * flipped both horizontally and vertically
 * (rgb -> vbgr; bgr -> vrgb).
