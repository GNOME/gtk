/*
 * LANDSCAPE means that the display is naturally landscape
 * (i.e. what almost all displays in the world use).
 * PORTRAIT means that the display is naturally portrait
 * (almost unheard of).
 * The number is the degrees the display is rotated clockwise
 * from its natural position.
 * I.e. most displays will have LANDSCAPE_0. A normal display
 * that is rotated by 90 degrees into portrait mode will
 * have LANDSCAPE_90. The same display rotated counter-clockwise
 * into portrait mode will have LANDSCAPE_270. The same display
 * rotated by 180 degrees (landscape again, but upside-down)
 * will have LANDSCAPE_180.
 * PORTRAIT is the same, but for displays that are normally
 * in portrait mode.
 * Accordingly, in LANDSCAPE_0 and PORTRAIT_0 modes
 * fontsmoothing is used as-is - i.e. it is assumed that
 * subpixes structure is horizontal (ClearType does not support
 * vertical subpixels; if the display has naturally vertical
 * subpixel structure, ClearType should be disabled altogether).
 * In LANDSCAPE_90 and PORTRAIT_90 subpixel structure has
 * its verticality flipped (rgb -> vrgb; bgr -> vbgr).
 * In LANDSCAPE_180 and PORTRAIT_180 subpixel structure is
 * horizontally flipped (rgb -> bgr; bgr -> rgb).
 * In LANDSCAPE_270 and PORTRAIT_270 subpixel structure is
 * flipped both horizontally and vertically
 * (rgb -> vbgr; bgr -> vrgb).
