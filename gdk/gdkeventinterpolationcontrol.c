/*
 * Maximum allowed time interval, in milliseconds, between the upcoming display
 * frame and the input event interpolation point. This limitation is necessary
 * in order to not get stuck with high latency due to transient hiccups in
 * the stream of received input events.
 *
 * Assuming a 60Hz display, frame time would be about 16.6ms. Since the most
 * recent input events in the interpolation history are from the previous frame
 * at the latest, there will be at least 16.6ms gap between the upcoming frame
 * and the most recent event. If due to some reason (display manager delay etc)
 * input events arrived a frame late, we already have at least 33ms gap.
 * Experimentally 40ms seems like a good hard limit for 60Hz displays, so about
 * 2.5 display frames.
 *
 * While the semi-arbitrary 40ms threshold works fine for screens having 60Hz
 * or higher refresh, it doesn't fit well screens with lower refresh rate. For
 * example, for laptops the screen refresh is often 50Hz, which means
 * 20ms/frame. So 40ms is only 2 frames which would not be enough. Then there
 * are 30Hz screens to consider, such as a 4K display over an HDMI v1.x
 * connection. So we set some relatively high hard latency limit, and
 * dynamically calculate a 'soft' limit based on the display refresh rate.

 * In order to achieve smooth movement, the interpolation point has to lie

 * we could 'interpolate' events outside this boundary - in this case that
 * would be called 'extrapolation' - the accuracy would be reduced, since this
 * would effectively be predicing the future or guessing the past. Furthermore,
 * the interpolation point must move in lockstep to the frame time. That's
 * because we want to calculate where the input device is located at the time
 * the frame is displayed, as opposed to when the event was generated.
 *
 * There is no point in trying to interpolate an event at the upcoming frame
 * time, since the upcoming frame time will always be later then the latest
 * event in the event history. In order to compensate for that, we maintain a
 * 'constant' offset from the frame time. This offset is the effective latency.
 * The offset should be constant since, as explained above, the interpolation
 * point should move in lockstep with the frame time.
 *
 * It should be noted that some latency always exists. Even if no interpolation
 * takes place, the frame displayed will be affected only by events that were
 * received before the frame was sent to the screen. When interpolation is
 * enabled the latency is made explicit, and will be somewhat larger than the
 * usual latency due to the constraints mentioned above. In the current
 * implementation the value of control->global_time_offset is the effective
 * latency in milliseconds.
 *
 * The higher the offset the bigger the latency, so we would like the get the
 * minimal fixed offset that still guarantees we'll always get an adjusted
 * interpolation point within the event history. That optimum offset depends on
 * a variety of factors: input event frequency, input event jitter, display
 * frame duration etc. Instead of trying to use a complicated formula to
 * calculate the offset, we simply increase it dynamically until it no longer
 * changes.
 *
 * How do we know by how much to increase the offset, and when to stop doing
 * that? On every animation callback we adjust the target offset if it's not
 * large enough to make the interpolation point smaller than, or equal to, the
 * timestamp of the newest event. We update it to the minimal value that
 * satisfies this condition. Eventually the offset will no longer change.
 *
 * We maintain a single global latency offset since the interpolation point
 * must be the same for all gestures currently in progress. Otherwise the
 * interpolated events of different devices would have values corresponding to
 * different time stamps.
 *
 * The offset is reset whenever no gesture is in progress, so this mechanism
 * should work even when the conditions change - for example if a new gesture
 * originated from another input device, or if the window was moved to a
 * different monitor screen.
