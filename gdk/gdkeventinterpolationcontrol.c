/*
 * Maximum allowed time interval, in milliseconds, between the upcoming display
 * frame and the input event interpolation point. This limitation is necessary
 * in order to not get stuck with high latency due to transient hiccups in
 * the stream of received input events.
 *
 * Assuming a 60Hz display, frame time would be about 16.6ms. Since the most
 * recent input events in the interpolation history are from the previous frame
 * at the latest, there will be at least 16.6ms gap between the upcoming frame
 * and the most recent event. If due to some reason (display manager delay etc)
 * input events arrived a frame late, we already have at least 33ms gap.
 * Experimentally 40ms seems like a good hard limit for 60Hz displays, so about
 * 2.5 display frames.
 *
 * While the semi-arbitrary 40ms threshold works fine for screens having 60Hz
 * or higher refresh, it doesn't fit well screens with lower refresh rate. For
 * example, for laptops the screen refresh is often 50Hz, which means
 * 20ms/frame. So 40ms is only 2 frames which would not be enough. Then there
 * are 30Hz screens to consider, such as a 4K display over an HDMI v1.x
 * connection. So we set some relatively high hard latency limit, and
 * dynamically calculate a 'soft' limit based on the display refresh rate.

 * GdkDeviceInterpolator maintains a queue of active gestures for a specific
 * (slave) input device.
 *
 * A 'gesture' in this context is a sequence of input events, from the 'start'
 * event, via 'update' events, up to the 'stop' event. For example, a pinch
 * gesture would start with the 'phase begin', continue with update events and
 * end with either a 'phase end' or a 'phase cancel'. For each active gesture a
 * separate event history is maintained.
 *
 * The gesture queue is required because it is possible to start a new gesture
 * while the event history of a previous gesture is still being drained. If a
 * new gesture is started while another is still in effect, then the new events
 * are stored in a separate event history buffer, which is added to the queue.
 * Once interpolating the first gesture is done, we start emitting events for
 * the next one.
 *
 * In certain circumstances it would be possible to get several gestures in the
 * queue - for example, if the interval between consecutive frames is, say,
 * several seconds. This might happen under heavy system or application load.
 *
 * While the code allows for an unlimited number of queued gestures, in reality
 * it's pretty hard to trigger a second gesture before the previous one
 * finished. Usually only a single event history would be used.
 *
 * Interpolated events are extracted from the oldest gesture in the queue.
 * Newly received events are pushed to the newest gesture in the queue. Since
 * most of the time there will only be a single ongoing gesture, events will
 * usually be pushed to and extracted from the same history.
 *
 * Once all events of a specific gesture are exhausted, the gesture is
 * discarded and we start emitting events from the next one until. This is
 * repeated until there are no more gestures in the queue.

 *
 * In the following diagrams time is denoted in milliseconds. The vsync event
 * is marked by the '|' characters. Input events are marked 'I'. The frame
 * clock "update" signal callbacks, marked Cn, occur about 1ms after the vsync.
 * The processing takes place in these callbacks. On each callback we handle
 * the input events from the previous display frame. The delta between the time
 * of the upcoming frame and the most recent event is calculated once per
 * frame, and the maximum delta calculated so far is kept as the offset.
 *
 * Case 1: Input frequency is higher than the screen refresh. This is a common
 * case - for example a standard 125Hz USB mouse connected to a 60Hz monitor.
 * For ease of demonstration we'll assume a fictional display refresh of 100Hz
 * and input frequency of about 250Hz. So vsync is every 10ms and input events
 * occur every 4ms.
 *
 * Time      0        10        20        30        40        50        60
 * VSync     |---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|-
 * Input        I   I   I   I   I : I   I   I   I   I : I   I   I   I   I
 * Callback1            C1        :         :         :
 * Offset1          [------------]:         :         :
 * Callback2                      C2        :         :
 * Offset2                      [----------]:         :
 * Callback3                                C3        :

 * Offset4                                          [----------]
 * ...
 *
 * In this case the first callback occurs at the 11ms mark. Two input events
 * were received so far, one at the 3ms mark and one at the 7ms mark. The next
 * vsync is at the 20ms mark, so the delta between the upcoming vsync and the
 * most recent event is (20 - 7) = 13. Since this is the first callback, we set
 * the offset to 13. In a similar fashion the delta in the 2nd callback is (30
 * - 19) = 11. We keep the offset at 13 since it's the biggest delta so far.
 * This process repeats in all the other callbacks.
 *
 * Case 2: Input frequency is lower than the screen refresh. This is the case,
 * for example, when an Apple external 'trackpad', which emits events at a
 * frequency of ~88Hz, is connected to a 240Hz "gaming" monitor. Here we'll
 * assume a fictional display refresh of 200Hz and input frequency of about
 * 83Hz. vsync is every 5ms, input events occur every 12ms.
 *
 * Time      0    5   10   15   20   25   30   35   40   45   50   55   60
 * VSync     |----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|-
 * Input         I :    :    I    :      I           I           I
 * Callback1       C1   :    :    :
 * Offset1       [-----]:    :    :
 * Callback2            C2   :    :
 * Offset2       [----------]:    :
 * Callback3                 C3   :
 * Offset3       [---------------]:
 * Callback4                      C4
 * Offset4                   [--------]
 * ...
 *
 * Here the first callback occurs at the 6ms mark. Only a single input event
 * was received so far, at the 4ms mark. The upcoming vsync is at the 10ms mark
 * so the delta is (10 - 4) = 6. We set the offset to 6 since this is the first
 * delta. The next callback occurs at the 11ms mark. We still only have the
 * first input event so the delta for this callback will be (15 - 4) = 11.
 * Since the delta is bigger than the previous one we now set the offset to 11.
 * In a similar vain the delta, and the offset, for the third callback is 16.
 * In the 4th callback we finally see a new input event, at the 16ms mark, so
 * the delta will be (25 - 16) = 9. However the biggest delta so far is 16 and
 * that will be kept as the offset. This process repeats in all the other
 * callbacks.
 *
 * These diagrams might tempt one to believe that we can simply set the offset
 * to be equal to (event interval + frame interval). However this is not the
 * case. As explained in the comment for update_interpolation_offset(), we
 * calculate the offset from "frame time" rather than presentation time. There
 * is no guarantee for frame time other than that it is usually at a constant,
 * unknown delta from the presentation time. Furthermore, input might be
 * jittery - i.e. not arrive at regular intervals.

 * In order to achieve smooth movement, the interpolation point has to lie

 * we could 'interpolate' events outside this boundary - in this case that
 * would be called 'extrapolation' - the accuracy would be reduced, since this
 * would effectively be predicing the future or guessing the past. Furthermore,
 * the interpolation point must move in lockstep to the presentation time.
 * That's because we want to calculate where the input device is located at the
 * time the frame is displayed, as opposed to when the event was generated.
 *
 * There is no point in trying to interpolate an event at the upcoming
 * presentation time, since the upcoming presentation time will always be later
 * then the latest event in the event history. In order to compensate for that,
 * we maintain a 'constant' offset from the presentation time. This offset is
 * the effective latency. The offset should be constant since, as explained
 * above, the interpolation point should move in lockstep with the presentation
 * time.
 *
 * The presentation time is usually not known in the first few display frames,
 * since we have to wait for the compositor to actually submit the frame in
 * order to get this information. If we'll wait till we can calculate the
 * presentation time we'll incur latency. So instead of using the presentation
 * time we use "frame time" as received from gdk_frame_clock_get_frame_time().
 * It is assumed that the frame time is at a constant offset from the actual
 * presentation time, otherwise no smooth animation would have been possible.
 *
 * It should be noted that some latency always exists. Even if no interpolation
 * takes place, the frame displayed will be affected only by events that were
 * received before the frame was sent to the screen. When interpolation is
 * enabled the latency is made explicit, and will be somewhat larger than the
 * usual latency due to the constraints mentioned above. In the current
 * implementation the value of control->global_time_offset is the effective
 * latency in milliseconds.
 *
 * The higher the offset the bigger the latency, so we would like the get the
 * minimal fixed offset that still guarantees we'll always get an adjusted
 * interpolation point within the event history. That optimum offset depends on
 * a variety of factors: input event frequency, input event jitter, display
 * frame duration etc. Instead of trying to use a complicated formula to
 * calculate the offset, we simply increase it dynamically until it no longer
 * changes.
 *
 * How do we know by how much to increase the offset, and when to stop doing
 * that? On every animation callback we adjust the target offset if it's not
 * large enough to make the interpolation point smaller than, or equal to, the
 * timestamp of the newest event. We update it to the minimal value that
 * satisfies this condition. Eventually the offset will no longer change.
 *
 * We maintain a single global latency offset since the interpolation point
 * must be the same for all gestures currently in progress. Otherwise the
 * interpolated events of different devices would have values corresponding to
 * different time stamps.
 *
 * The offset is reset whenever no gesture is in progress, so this mechanism
 * should work even when the conditions change - for example if a new gesture
 * originated from another input device, or if the window was moved to a
 * different monitor screen.
