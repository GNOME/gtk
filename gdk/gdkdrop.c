/**
 * GdkDrop:
 *
 * The `GdkDrop` object represents the target of an ongoing DND operation.
 *
 * Possible drop sites get informed about the status of the ongoing drag
 * operation with events of type %GDK_DRAG_ENTER, %GDK_DRAG_LEAVE,
 * %GDK_DRAG_MOTION and %GDK_DROP_START. The `GdkDrop` object can be obtained
 * from these [class@Gdk.Event] types using [method@Gdk.DNDEvent.get_drop].
 *
 * The actual data transfer is initiated from the target side via an async
 * read, using one of the `GdkDrop` methods for this purpose:
 * [method@Gdk.Drop.read_async] or [method@Gdk.Drop.read_value_async].
 *
 * GTK provides a higher level abstraction based on top of these functions,
 * and so they are not normally needed in GTK applications. See the
 * "Drag and Drop" section of the GTK documentation for more information.
