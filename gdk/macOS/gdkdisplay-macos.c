/**
 * SECTION:macos_interaction
 * @Short_description: macOS backend-specific functions
 * @Title: macOS Interaction
 * @Include: gdk/macos/gdkmacos.h
 *
 * The functions in this section are specific to the GDK macOS backend.
 * To use them, you need to include the `<gdk/macos/gdkmacos.h>` header and
 * use the macOS-specific pkg-config `gtk4-macos` file to build your
 * application.
 *
 * To make your code compile with other GDK backends, guard backend-specific
 * calls by an ifdef as follows. Since GDK may be built with multiple
 * backends, you should also check for the backend that is in use (e.g. by
 * using the GDK_IS_MACOS_DISPLAY() macro).
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * #ifdef GDK_WINDOWING_MACOS
 *   if (GDK_IS_MACOS_DISPLAY (display))
 *     {
 *       // make macOS-specific calls here
 *     }
 *   else
 * #endif
 * #ifdef GDK_WINDOWING_X11
 *   if (GDK_IS_X11_DISPLAY (display))
 *     {
 *       // make X11-specific calls here
 *     }
 *   else
 * #endif
 *   g_error ("Unsupported GDK backend");
