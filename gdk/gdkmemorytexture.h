 *
 * #GdkMemoryFormat describes a format that bytes can have in memory.
 *
 * It describes formats by listing the contents of the memory passed to it.
 * So GDK_MEMORY_A8R8G8B8 will be 1 byte (8 bits) of alpha, followed by a
 * byte each of red, green and blue. It is not endian-dependent, so
 * CAIRO_FORMAT_ARGB32 is represented by different #GdkMemoryFormats on
 * architectures with different endiannesses.
 * 
 * Its naming is modelled after VkFormat (see
 * https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.0/html/vkspec.html#VkFormat
 * for details).
