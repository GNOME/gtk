 * We need at least 2-3 display-frames worth of input events in the history

 * time it takes an event to reach this code. Display frames can last anywhere
 * from 33ms to about 4ms on today's monitors, corresponding to 30 FPS to 240
 * FPS.
 *
 * While the average USB-connected input device generates about 125 events per
 * second, high frequency devices such as 'gamer' mice can generate up to 1000
 * events per second. Taking the extremes here, a combination of an input
 * device that generates an event every millisecond, coupled with a monitor
 * capable of only 30 frames per second, we'll need about 33 events per frame
 * so a total of about 66 events in the buffer. In addition, to support fancier
 * interpolation methods in the future we'll need about 8 events in total and
 * maybe even more, so this is covered as well.

 * which we get delta values - we get the value relative to the previous event.
 * These include the (delta_x, delta_y) of precise scroll events, the scale of
 * pinch events etc. 'Discrete' properties are those with a discrete rather
 * than continuous set of values. For example the 'state' member of various
 * event types, the 'is_stop' field of scroll events etc.
 *
 * In this section we generally assume that the events only contain 'absolute'
 * and 'discrete' properties. 'Relative' properties are dealt with later, in
