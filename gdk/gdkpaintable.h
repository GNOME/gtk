 *     only the area in the rectangle from (0,0) to (width, height).
 *     This is the only function that must be implemented for this interface.
 * @get_current_image: return a #GdkPaintable that does not change over
 *     time. This means the GDK_PAINTABLE_STATIC_SIZE and
 *     %GDK_PAINTABLE_STATIC_CONTENTS flag are set.
 * @get_flags: Get the flags for this instance. See #GdkPaintableFlags
 *     for details.
 * @get_intrinsic_width: The preferred width for this object to be
 *     snapshot at or 0 if none. This is purely a hint. The object must still
 *     be able to render at any size.
 * @get_intrinsic_height: The preferred height for this object to be
 *     snapshot at or 0 if none. This is purely a hint. The object must still
 *     be able to render at any size.
 * @get_intrinsic_aspect_ratio: The preferred aspect ratio for this object
 *     or 0 if none. If both GdkPaintable:get_intrinsic_width() and
 *     GdkPaintable:get_intrinsic_height() return non-zero values, this function
 *     should return the aspect ratio computed from those.
 *
 * The list of functions that can be implemented for the #GdkPaintable interface.
 * Note that apart from the first function, no function is mandatory to implement,
 * though it is a good idea to implement GdkPaintable:get_current_image() for
 * non-static paintables and GdkPaintable:get_flags() if the image is not dynamic
 * as the default implementation returns no flags and that will make the
 * implementation likely quite slow.
