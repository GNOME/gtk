/**

 * @Title: GdkPaintable
 * @Short_description: An interface for a paintable region
 * @See_also: #ClutterContent, #GtkImage, #GdkTexture, #GtkSnapshot
 *
 * #GdkPaintable is a simple interface used by GDK and GDK to represent
 * objects that can be painted anywhere at any size without requiring any
 * sort of layout. The interface is inspired by similar concepts elsewhere,
 * such as #ClutterContent, <ulink
 * linkend="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-images-4/#paint-source">HTML/CSS Paint
 * Sources</ulink> or <ulink linkend="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/pservers.html">
 * SVG Paint Servers</ulink>.
 *
 * A #GdkPaintable can be snapshot at any time and size using
 * gdk_paintable_snapshot(). How the paintable interprets that size and if it
 * scales or centers itself into the given rectangle is implementation defined,
 * though if you are implementing a #GdkPaintable and don't know what to do, it
 * is suggested that you scale your paintable ignoring any potential aspect ratio.
 *
 * The contents that a #GdkPaintable produces may depend on the #GdkSnapshot passed
 * to it. For example, paintables may decide to use more detailed images on higher
 * resolution screens or when OpenGL is available. A #GdkPaintable will however
 * always produce the same output for the same snapshot.
 *
 * A #GdkPaintable may change its contents, meaning that it will now produce a
 * different output with the same snpashot. Once that happens, it will call
 * gdk_paintable_invalidate_contents() which will emit the
 * #GdkPaintable::invalidate-contents signal.  
 * If a paintable is known to never change its contents, it will set the
 * %GDK_PAINTABLE_STATIC_CONTENT flag. If a consumer cannot deal with changing
 * contents, it may call gdk_paintable_get_static_image() which will return a
 * static paintable and use that.
 *
 * A paintable can report an intrinsic (or preferred) size or aspect ratio it
 * wishes to be rendered at, though it doesn't have to. Consumers of the interface
 * can use this information to layout thepaintable appropriately.
 * Just like the contents, the size of a paintable can change. A paintable will
 * indicate this by calling gdk_paintable_invalidate_size() which will emit the
 * #GdkPaintable::invalidate-size signal.
 * And just like for contents, if a paintable is known to never change its size,
 * it will set the %GDK_PAINTABLE_STATIC_SIZE flag.
