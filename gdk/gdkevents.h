 * @GDK_EVENT_LAST: marks the end of the GdkEventType enumeration. Added in 2.18
 *
 * Specifies the type of the event.
 *
 * Do not confuse these events with the signals that GTK+ widgets emit.
 * Although many of these events result in corresponding signals being emitted,
 * the events are often transformed or filtered along the way.
 *
 * In some language bindings, the values %GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS and
 * %GDK_3BUTTON_PRESS would translate into something syntactically
 * invalid (eg `Gdk.EventType.2ButtonPress`, where a
