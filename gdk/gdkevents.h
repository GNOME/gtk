 *   progress.
 * @GDK_DROP_START: a drop operation onto the surface has started.
 * @GDK_SCROLL: the scroll wheel was turned
 * @GDK_GRAB_BROKEN: a pointer or keyboard grab was broken. This event type
 *   was added in 2.8.
 * @GDK_TOUCH_BEGIN: A new touch event sequence has just started. This event
 *   type was added in 3.4.
 * @GDK_TOUCH_UPDATE: A touch event sequence has been updated. This event type
 *   was added in 3.4.
 * @GDK_TOUCH_END: A touch event sequence has finished. This event type
 *   was added in 3.4.
 * @GDK_TOUCH_CANCEL: A touch event sequence has been canceled. This event type
 *   was added in 3.4.
 * @GDK_TOUCHPAD_SWIPE: A touchpad swipe gesture event, the current state
 *   is determined by its phase field. This event type was added in 3.18.
 * @GDK_TOUCHPAD_PINCH: A touchpad pinch gesture event, the current state
 *   is determined by its phase field. This event type was added in 3.18.
 * @GDK_PAD_BUTTON_PRESS: A tablet pad button press event. This event type
 *   was added in 3.22.
 * @GDK_PAD_BUTTON_RELEASE: A tablet pad button release event. This event type

 * @GDK_EVENT_LAST: marks the end of the GdkEventType enumeration. Added in 2.18
 *
 * Specifies the type of the event.
 *
 * Do not confuse these events with the signals that GTK+ widgets emit.
 * Although many of these events result in corresponding signals being emitted,
 * the events are often transformed or filtered along the way.
