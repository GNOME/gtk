/*
 * GdkMemoryFormat:
 *
 * #GdkMemroyFormat describes a format that bytes can have in memory.
 *
 * It describes formats by listing the contents of the memory passed to it.
 * So GDK_MEMORY_A8R8G8B8 will be 8 bits of alpha, followed by 8 bites of each 
 * blue, green and red. It is not endian-dependant, so CAIRO_FORMAT_ARGB32 is
 * represented by 2 different GdkMemoryFormats.
 * 
 * Its naming is modelled after VkFormat (see
 * https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.0/html/vkspec.html#VkFormat
 * for details).
