 *   @surface and are only reported if selected by @event_mask. If %TRUE then
 *   pointer events for this application are reported as normal, but pointer
 *   events outside this application are reported with respect to @surface and
 *   only if selected by @event_mask. In either mode, unreported events are
 *   discarded.
 * @cursor: (nullable): the cursor to display while the grab is active.
 *   If this is %NULL then the normal cursors are used for @surface and
 *   its descendants, and the cursor for @surface is used elsewhere.
 * @event: (nullable): the event that is triggering the grab, or %NULL if none
 *   is available.
 * @prepare_func: (nullable) (scope call): function to prepare the surface
 *   to be grabbed, it can be %NULL if @surface is visible before this call.
 * @prepare_func_data: (closure): user data to pass to @prepare_func
 *
 * Grabs the seat so that all events corresponding to the given @capabilities
 * are passed to this application.
 *
 * The grab remains in place until the seat is ungrabbed with
 * [method@Gdk.Seat.ungrab], or the surface becomes hidden. This overrides
 * any previous grab on the seat by this client.
 *
 * As a rule of thumb, if a grab is desired over %GDK_SEAT_CAPABILITY_POINTER,
 * all other "pointing" capabilities (eg. %GDK_SEAT_CAPABILITY_TOUCH) should
 * be grabbed too, so the user is able to interact with all of those while
 * the grab holds, you should thus use %GDK_SEAT_CAPABILITY_ALL_POINTING most
 * commonly.
 *
 * Grabs are used for operations which need complete control over the
 * events corresponding to the given capabilities. For example in GTK this
 * is used for Drag and Drop operations, popup menus and such.
 *
 * Note that if the event mask of a `GdkSurface` has selected both button press
 * and button release events, or touch begin and touch end, then a press event
 * will cause an automatic grab until the button is released, equivalent to a
 * grab on the surface with @owner_events set to %TRUE. This is done because
 * most applications expect to receive paired press and release events.
 *
 * If you set up anything at the time you take the grab that needs to be
 * cleaned up when the grab ends, you should handle the `GdkEventGrabBroken`
 * events that are emitted when the grab ends unvoluntarily.
 *
 * Returns: %GDK_GRAB_SUCCESS if the grab was successful.
