/**

 * @Short_description: Library initialization and miscellaneous functions
 * @Title: General
 *
 * This section describes the GDK initialization functions and miscellaneous
 * utility functions, as well as deprecation facilities.
 *
 * The GDK and GTK+ headers annotate deprecated APIs in a way that produces
 * compiler warnings if these deprecated APIs are used. The warnings
 * can be turned off by defining the macro %GDK_DISABLE_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS
 * before including the glib.h header.
 *
 * GDK and GTK+ also provide support for building applications against
 * defined subsets of deprecated or new APIs. Define the macro
 * %GDK_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED to specify up to what version
 * you want to receive warnings about deprecated APIs. Define the
 * macro %GDK_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED to specify the newest version
 * whose API you want to use.

/**
 * SECTION:threads
 * @Short_description: Functions for using GDK in multi-threaded programs
 * @Title: Threads
 *
 * For thread safety, GDK relies on the thread primitives in GLib,
 * and on the thread-safe GLib main loop.
 *
 * GLib is completely thread safe (all global data is automatically
 * locked), but individual data structure instances are not automatically
 * locked for performance reasons. So e.g. you must coordinate
 * accesses to the same #GHashTable from multiple threads.
 *
 * GTK+, however, is not thread safe. You should only use GTK+ and GDK
 * from the thread gtk_init() and gtk_main() were called on.
 * This is usually referred to as the “main thread”.
 *
 * Signals on GTK+ and GDK types, as well as non-signal callbacks, are
 * emitted in the main thread.
 *
 * You can schedule work in the main thread safely from other threads
 * by using g_main_context_invoke(), g_idle_add(), and g_timeout_add():
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * static void
 * worker_thread (void)
 * {
 *   ExpensiveData *expensive_data = do_expensive_computation ();
 *
 *   g_main_context_invoke (NULL, got_value, expensive_data);
 * }
 *
 * static gboolean
 * got_value (gpointer user_data)
 * {
 *   ExpensiveData *expensive_data = user_data;
 *
 *   my_app->expensive_data = expensive_data;
 *   gtk_button_set_sensitive (my_app->button, TRUE);
 *   gtk_button_set_label (my_app->button, expensive_data->result_label);
 *
 *   return G_SOURCE_REMOVE;
 * }
 * ]|
 *
 * For more information on this "worker thread" pattern, you should
 * also look at #GTask, which gives you high-level tools to perform
 * expensive tasks from worker threads, and will handle thread
 * management for you.
