 * @Title: Frame timings
 *
 * A #GdkFrameTimings object holds timing information for a single frame
 * of the application’s displays. To retrieve #GdkFrameTimings objects,
 * use gdk_frame_clock_get_timings() or gdk_frame_clock_get_current_timings().
 * The information in #GdkFrameTimings is useful for precise synchronization
 * of video with the event or audio streams, and for measuring
 * quality metrics for the application’s display, such as latency and jitter.
