 * @GDK_MODIFIER_MASK: a mask covering all modifier types.
 *
 * A set of bit-flags to indicate the state of modifier keys and mouse buttons

 *
 * Like the X Window System, GDK supports 8 modifier keys and 5 mouse buttons.
 *
 * Since 2.10, GDK recognizes which of the Meta, Super or Hyper keys are mapped

 * %GDK_HYPER_MASK or %GDK_META_MASK in the state field of key events.
 *
 * Note that GDK may add internal values to events which include
 * reserved values such as %GDK_MODIFIER_RESERVED_13_MASK.  Your code
 * should preserve and ignore them.  You can use %GDK_MODIFIER_MASK to
 * remove all reserved values.
 *
 * Also note that the GDK X backend interprets button press events for button
 * 4-7 as scroll events, so %GDK_BUTTON4_MASK and %GDK_BUTTON5_MASK will never
