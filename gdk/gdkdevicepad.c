/**
 * SECTION:gdkdevicepad
 * @Short_description: Pad device interface
 * @Title: GtkDevicePad
 *
 * #GdkDevicePad is an interface implemented by devices of type
 * %GDK_SOURCE_TABLET_PAD, it allows querying the features provided
 * by the pad device.
 *
 * Tablet pads may contain one or more groups, each containing a subset
 * of the buttons/rings/strips available. gdk_device_pad_get_n_groups()
 * can be used to obtain the number of groups, gdk_device_pad_get_n_features()
 * and gdk_device_pad_get_feature_group() can be combined to find out the
 * number of buttons/rings/strips the device has, and how are they grouped.
 *
 * Each of those groups have different modes, which may be used to map
 * each individual pad feature to multiple actions. Only one mode is
 * effective (current) for each given group, different groups may have
 * different current modes. The number of available modes in a group can
 * be found out through gdk_device_pad_get_group_n_modes(), and the current
 * mode for a given group will be notified through the #GdkEventPadGroupMode
 * event.
