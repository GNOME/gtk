    <description summary="desktop-style metadata interface">
      An interface that may be implemented by a wl_surface, for
      implementations that provide a desktop-style user interface.

      It provides requests to treat surfaces like windows, allowing to set
      properties like maximized, fullscreen, minimized, and to move and resize
      them, and associate metadata like title and app id.

      On the server side the object is automatically destroyed when
      the related wl_surface is destroyed.  On client side,
      xdg_surface.destroy() must be called before destroying
      the wl_surface object.

	The edges parameter provides a hint about how the surface
	was resized. The client may use this information to decide
	how to adjust its content to the new size (e.g. a scrolling
	area might adjust its content position to leave the viewable
	content unmoved). Valid edge values are from resize_edge enum.

	The maximized parameter informs if the surface is in a maximized
	state. Same for the fullscreen parameter.

	The client is free to dismiss all but the last configure
	event it received.

	The width and height arguments specify the size of the window
	in surface local coordinates.

      An interface that may be implemented by a wl_surface, for

      surface is a transient surface with an added pointer grab.

      An existing implicit grab will be changed to owner-events mode,
      and the popup grab will continue after the implicit grab ends
      (i.e. releasing the mouse button does not cause the popup to be
      unmapped).

      The popup grab continues until the window is destroyed or a mouse
      button is pressed in any other clients window. A click in any of
      the clients surfaces is reported as normal, however, clicks in
      other clients surfaces will be discarded and trigger the callback.

      The x and y arguments specify the locations of the upper left
      corner of the surface relative to the upper left corner of the
      parent surface, in surface local coordinates.

      xdg_popup surfaces are always transient for another surface.
