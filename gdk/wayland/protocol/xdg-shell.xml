        The compositor might use this information to move a surface
        to the top left only when the client has drawn itself for

        The window geometry of a window is its "visible bounds" from the

        portions like drop-shadows which should be ignored for the
        purposes of aligning, placing and constraining windows.

        Once the window geometry of the surface is set once, it is not
        possible to unset it, and it will remain the same until
        set_window_geometry is called again, even if a new subsurface or
        buffer is attached.

        If never set, the value is the full bounds of the surface,
        including any subsurfaces. This updates dynamically on every
        commit. This unset mode is meant for extremely simple clients.

        If responding to a configure event, the window geometry in here
        must respect the sizing negotiations specified by the states in
        the configure event.

  <interface name="xdg_popup" version="1">
    <description summary="short-lived, popup surfaces for menus">
      A popup surface is a short-lived, temporary surface that can be
      used to implement menus. It takes an explicit grab on the surface
      that will be dismissed when the user dismisses the popup. This can
      be done by the user clicking outside the surface, using the keyboard,
      or even locking the screen through closing the lid or a timeout.

      When the popup is dismissed, a popup_done event will be sent out,
      and at the same time the surface will be unmapped. The xdg_popup
      object is now inert and cannot be reactivated, so clients should
      destroy it. Explicitly destroying the xdg_popup object will also
      dismiss the popup and unmap the surface.

      Clients will receive events for all their surfaces during this
      grab (which is an "owner-events" grab in X11 parlance). This is
      done so that users can navigate through submenus and other
      "nested" popup windows without having to dismiss the topmost
      popup.

      Clients that want to dismiss the popup when another surface of
      their own is clicked should dismiss the popup using the destroy
      request.

      The parent surface must have either an xdg_surface or xdg_popup
      role.

      Specifying an xdg_popup for the parent means that the popups are
      nested, with this popup now being the topmost popup. Nested
      popups must be destroyed in the reverse order they were created
      in, e.g. the only popup you are allowed to destroy at all times
      is the topmost one.

      If there is an existing popup when creating a new popup, the
      parent must be the current topmost popup.

      A parent surface must be mapped before the new popup is mapped.

      When compositors choose to dismiss a popup, they will likely
      dismiss every nested popup as well.

      The x and y arguments specify where the top left of the popup
      should be placed, relative to the local surface coordinates of the
      parent surface.
