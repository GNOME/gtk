 * GdkDrawContext:

 * Base class for objects implementing different rendering methods.

 * `GdkDrawContext` is the base object used by contexts implementing different
 * rendering methods, such as [class@Gdk.CairoContext] or [class@Gdk.GLContext].
 * It provides shared functionality between those contexts.
 *
 * You will always interact with one of those subclasses.
 *
 * A `GdkDrawContext` is always associated with a single toplevel surface.

 *
 * Note that the @region passed to this function is the minimum region that
 * needs to be drawn and depending on implementation, windowing system and

 * implementation must use [method@Gdk.DrawContext.get_frame_region] to

 * 2. Check if the compositor supports high depth.
 * 3. Check if the compositor prefers regular bit depth. This is usually the case
