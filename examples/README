== Building the examples ==

The examples in this directory are built alongside the rest of GTK+.

The examples under the `application[1-9]` directories are also included in
the GTK+ API reference documentation, and can be built independently, using
the system libraries, by doing:

    $ cd application1
    $ make -f Makefile.example
