How to do a GTK+ release?
=========================

Make sure you have Owen's special autoconf and libtool RPMs, available at:
http://people.redhat.com/otaylor/gtk/autotools/.

Also make sure you have the following packages installed with all their
dependencies (I used the RPM package names from RedHat 9):
* gtk-doc
* linuxdoc-tools
* docbook-utils

Without those packages make distcheck will *not* pass.


0) Blow away your gtk+ directory, check a new version out
1) autogen and build it, make sure to enable docs.
2) Update NEWS based on the various ChangeLog files
3) Verify that the version in configure.in has been bumped after the last
release. (Note that this is critical, a slip-up here will cause the soname 
to change).
4) Make sure that make check is happy (If you don't do it here, make distcheck
will also catch it, but it is kind of disheartening to see make distcheck fail
due to an extraneous symbol after watching it build the docs for an hour...)
5) Add === Released 2.x.y === at the top of all ChangeLog files
6) make distcheck
7) Fix broken stuff found by 5) repeat
8) cvs commit; you'll have a bunch of po file changes, and maybe some
doc changes too (NOTE: be sure to use cvs with compression, else you'll
end up waiting for a long time :).
9) If 7) fails because someone else committed inbetween, curse, cvs up,
fix conflicts and go to 5)
10) type 'cvs tag GTK_2_x_y' in the toplevel directory
11) You now have the tarball, and the CVS tag, now upload the tarball to
gnome.org and gtk.org
12) Go to the gnome-announce list archives, find the last announce message,
create a new message in the same form, replacing version numbers, commentary
at the top about "what this release is about" and the Summary of changes.
13) Send it to gnome-announce-list, gtk-list, gtk-app-devel-list and
gtk-devel-list. Set reply-to to gnome-hackers.
14) Bump the version number in configure.in. 
15) Create a new milestone in bugzilla and move the remaining bugs from the
2.x.y milestone over to the new one.
16) Add a link to the release announcement to www.gtk.org which lives in
the gtk-web cvs module.
