<p>
GTK (GIMP Toolkit) is a library for creating graphical user
interfaces. It is licensed using the LGPL license, so you can develop
open software, free software, or even commercial non-free software
using GTK without having to spend anything for licenses or royalties.

It's called the GIMP toolkit because it was originally written for
developing the GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP), but GTK has
now been used in a large number of software projects, including the
GNU Network Object Model Environment (GNOME) project. GTK is built on
top of GDK (GIMP Drawing Kit) which is basically a wrapper around the
low-level functions for accessing the underlying windowing functions
(Xlib in the case of the X windows system). The primary authors of GTK
are:

<itemize>
<item> Peter Mattis   <tt><htmlurl url="mailto:petm@xcf.berkeley.edu"
			   name="petm@xcf.berkeley.edu"></tt>
<item> Spencer Kimball <tt><htmlurl url="mailto:spencer@xcf.berkeley.edu"
			   name="spencer@xcf.berkeley.edu"></tt>
<item> Josh MacDonald <tt><htmlurl url="mailto:jmacd@xcf.berkeley.edu"
			   name="jmacd@xcf.berkeley.edu"></tt>
</itemize>

GTK is essentially an object oriented application programmers
interface (API). Although written completely in C, it is implemented
using the idea of classes and callback functions (pointers to
functions).

There is also a third component called GLib which contains a few
replacements for some standard calls, as well as some additional
functions for handling linked lists, etc. The replacement functions
are used to increase GTK's portability, as some of the functions
implemented here are not available or are nonstandard on other unixes
such as g_strerror(). Some also contain enhancements to the libc
versions, such as g_malloc that has enhanced debugging utilities.

This tutorial describes the C interface to GTK. There are GTK
bindings for many other languages including C++, Guile, Perl, Python,
TOM, Ada95, Objective C, Free Pascal, and Eiffel. If you intend to
use another language's bindings to GTK, look at that binding's
documentation first. In some cases that documentation may describe
some important conventions (which you should know first) and then
refer you back to this tutorial. There are also some cross-platform
APIs (such as wxWindows and V) which use GTK as one of their target
platforms; again, consult their documentation first.

If you're developing your GTK application in C++, a few extra notes
are in order. There's a C++ binding to GTK called GTK--, which
provides a more C++-like interface to GTK; you should probably look
into this instead. If you don't like that approach for whatever
reason, there are two alternatives for using GTK. First, you can use
only the C subset of C++ when interfacing with GTK and then use the C
interface as described in this tutorial. Second, you can use GTK and
C++ together by declaring all callbacks as static functions in C++
classes, and again calling GTK using its C interface. If you choose
this last approach, you can include as the callback's data value a
pointer to the object to be manipulated (the so-called "this" value).
Selecting between these options is simply a matter of preference,
since in all three approaches you get C++ and GTK. None of these
approaches requires the use of a specialized preprocessor, so no
matter what you choose you can use standard C++ with GTK.

This tutorial is an attempt to document as much as possible of GTK,
but it is by no means complete. This tutorial assumes a good
understanding of C, and how to create C programs. It would be a great
benefit for the reader to have previous X programming experience, but
it shouldn't be necessary. If you are learning GTK as your first
widget set, please comment on how you found this tutorial, and what
you had trouble with. There are also C++, Objective C, ADA, Guile and
other language bindings available, but I don't follow these.

This document is a "work in progress". Please look for updates on
<htmlurl url="http://www.gtk.org/" name="http://www.gtk.org/">.

I would very much like to hear of any problems you have learning GTK
from this document, and would appreciate input as to how it may be
improved. Please see the section on <ref id="sec_Contributing"
name="Contributing"> for further information.

<!-- ***************************************************************** -->
<sect>Getting Started
<!-- ***************************************************************** -->

<p>
The first thing to do, of course, is download the GTK source and
install it. You can always get the latest version from ftp.gtk.org in
/pub/gtk. You can also view other sources of GTK information on
<htmlurl url="http://www.gtk.org/" name="http://www.gtk.org/">. GTK
uses GNU autoconf for configuration. Once untar'd, type ./configure
--help to see a list of options.

The GTK source distribution also contains the complete source to all
of the examples used in this tutorial, along with Makefiles to aid
compilation.

To begin our introduction to GTK, we'll start with the simplest
program possible. This program will create a 200x200 pixel window and
has no way of exiting except to be killed by using the shell.

<tscreen><verb>
/* example-start base base.c */

#include <gtk/gtk.h>

int main( int   argc,
          char *argv[] )
{
    GtkWidget *window;
    
    gtk_init (&amp;argc, &amp;argv);
    
    window = gtk_window_new (GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
    gtk_widget_show  (window);
    
    gtk_main ();
    
    return(0);
}
/* example-end */
</verb></tscreen>

You can compile the above program with gcc using:
<tscreen><verb>
gcc base.c -o base `gtk-config --cflags --libs`
</verb></tscreen>

The meaning of the unusual compilation options is explained below in
<ref id="sec_compiling" name="Compiling Hello World">.

All programs will of course include gtk/gtk.h which declares the
variables, functions, structures, etc. that will be used in your GTK
application.

The next line:

<tscreen><verb>
gtk_init (&amp;argc, &amp;argv);
</verb></tscreen>

calls the function gtk_init(gint *argc, gchar ***argv) which will be
called in all GTK applications. This sets up a few things for us such
as the default visual and color map and then proceeds to call
gdk_init(gint *argc, gchar ***argv). This function initializes the
library for use, sets up default signal handlers, and checks the
arguments passed to your application on the command line, looking for
one of the following:

<itemize>
<item> <tt/--gtk-module/
<item> <tt/--g-fatal-warnings/
<item> <tt/--gtk-debug/
<item> <tt/--gtk-no-debug/
<item> <tt/--gdk-debug/
<item> <tt/--gdk-no-debug/
<item> <tt/--display/
<item> <tt/--sync/
<item> <tt/--no-xshm/
<item> <tt/--name/
<item> <tt/--class/
</itemize>

It removes these from the argument list, leaving anything it does not
recognize for your application to parse or ignore. This creates a set
of standard arguments accepted by all GTK applications.

The next two lines of code create and display a window.

<tscreen><verb>
  window = gtk_window_new (GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
  gtk_widget_show (window);
</verb></tscreen>

The <tt/GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL/ argument specifies that we want the
window to undergo window manager decoration and placement. Rather than
create a window of 0x0 size, a window without children is set to
200x200 by default so you can still manipulate it.

The gtk_widget_show() function lets GTK know that we are done setting
the attributes of this widget, and that it can display it.

The last line enters the GTK main processing loop.

<tscreen><verb>
  gtk_main ();
</verb></tscreen>

gtk_main() is another call you will see in every GTK application.
When control reaches this point, GTK will sleep waiting for X events
(such as button or key presses), timeouts, or file IO notifications to
occur. In our simple example, however, events are ignored.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Hello World in GTK
<p>
Now for a program with a widget (a button).  It's the classic
hello world a la GTK.

<tscreen><verb>
/* example-start helloworld helloworld.c */

#include <gtk/gtk.h>

/* This is a callback function. The data arguments are ignored
 * in this example. More on callbacks below. */
void hello( GtkWidget *widget,
            gpointer   data )
{
    g_print ("Hello World\n");
}

gint delete_event( GtkWidget *widget,
                   GdkEvent  *event,
		   gpointer   data )
{
    /* If you return FALSE in the "delete_event" signal handler,
     * GTK will emit the "destroy" signal. Returning TRUE means
     * you don't want the window to be destroyed.
     * This is useful for popping up 'are you sure you want to quit?'
     * type dialogs. */

    g_print ("delete event occurred\n");

    /* Change TRUE to FALSE and the main window will be destroyed with
     * a "delete_event". */

    return(TRUE);
}

/* Another callback */
void destroy( GtkWidget *widget,
              gpointer   data )
{
    gtk_main_quit();
}

int main( int   argc,
          char *argv[] )
{
    /* GtkWidget is the storage type for widgets */
    GtkWidget *window;
    GtkWidget *button;
    
    /* This is called in all GTK applications. Arguments are parsed
     * from the command line and are returned to the application. */
    gtk_init(&amp;argc, &amp;argv);
    
    /* create a new window */
    window = gtk_window_new (GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
    
    /* When the window is given the "delete_event" signal (this is given
     * by the window manager, usually by the "close" option, or on the
     * titlebar), we ask it to call the delete_event () function
     * as defined above. The data passed to the callback
     * function is NULL and is ignored in the callback function. */
    gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT (window), "delete_event",
			GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (delete_event), NULL);
    
    /* Here we connect the "destroy" event to a signal handler.  
     * This event occurs when we call gtk_widget_destroy() on the window,
     * or if we return FALSE in the "delete_event" callback. */
    gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT (window), "destroy",
			GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (destroy), NULL);
    
    /* Sets the border width of the window. */
    gtk_container_set_border_width (GTK_CONTAINER (window), 10);
    
    /* Creates a new button with the label "Hello World". */
    button = gtk_button_new_with_label ("Hello World");
    
    /* When the button receives the "clicked" signal, it will call the
     * function hello() passing it NULL as its argument.  The hello()
     * function is defined above. */
    gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT (button), "clicked",
			GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (hello), NULL);
    
    /* This will cause the window to be destroyed by calling
     * gtk_widget_destroy(window) when "clicked".  Again, the destroy
     * signal could come from here, or the window manager. */
    gtk_signal_connect_object (GTK_OBJECT (button), "clicked",
			       GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (gtk_widget_destroy),
			       GTK_OBJECT (window));
    
    /* This packs the button into the window (a gtk container). */
    gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (window), button);
    
    /* The final step is to display this newly created widget. */
    gtk_widget_show (button);
    
    /* and the window */
    gtk_widget_show (window);
    
    /* All GTK applications must have a gtk_main(). Control ends here
     * and waits for an event to occur (like a key press or
     * mouse event). */
    gtk_main ();
    
    return(0);
}
/* example-end */
</verb></tscreen>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Compiling Hello World <label id="sec_compiling">
<p>
To compile use:

<tscreen><verb>
gcc -Wall -g helloworld.c -o helloworld `gtk-config --cflags` \
    `gtk-config --libs`
</verb></tscreen>

This uses the program <tt/gtk-config/, which comes with GTK. This
program "knows" what compiler switches are needed to compile programs
that use GTK. <tt/gtk-config --cflags/ will output a list of include
directories for the compiler to look in, and <tt>gtk-config --libs</>
will output the list of libraries for the compiler to link with and
the directories to find them in. In the above example they could have
been combined into a single instance, such as
<tt/`gtk-config --cflags --libs`/.

Note that the type of single quote used in the compile command above
is significant.

The libraries that are usually linked in are:
<itemize>
<item>The GTK library (-lgtk), the widget library, based on top of GDK.
<item>The GDK library (-lgdk), the Xlib wrapper.
<item>The gmodule library (-lgmodule), which is used to load run time
extensions.
<item>The GLib library (-lglib), containing miscellaneous functions;
only g_print() is used in this particular example. GTK is built on top
of glib so you will always require this library. See the section on
<ref id="sec_glib" name="GLib"> for details.
<item>The Xlib library (-lX11) which is used by GDK.
<item>The Xext library (-lXext). This contains code for shared memory
pixmaps and other X extensions.
<item>The math library (-lm). This is used by GTK for various purposes.
</itemize>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Theory of Signals and Callbacks
<p>
Before we look in detail at <em>helloworld</em>, we'll discuss signals
and callbacks. GTK is an event driven toolkit, which means it will
sleep in gtk_main until an event occurs and control is passed to the
appropriate function.

This passing of control is done using the idea of "signals". (Note
that these signals are not the same as the Unix system signals, and
are not implemented using them, although the terminology is almost
identical.) When an event occurs, such as the press of a mouse button,
the appropriate signal will be "emitted" by the widget that was
pressed.  This is how GTK does most of its useful work. There are
signals that all widgets inherit, such as "destroy", and there are
signals that are widget specific, such as "toggled" on a toggle
button.

To make a button perform an action, we set up a signal handler to
catch these signals and call the appropriate function. This is done by
using a function such as:

<tscreen><verb>
gint gtk_signal_connect( GtkObject     *object,
                         gchar         *name,
                         GtkSignalFunc  func,
                         gpointer       func_data );
</verb></tscreen>

where the first argument is the widget which will be emitting the
signal, and the second the name of the signal you wish to catch. The
third is the function you wish to be called when it is caught, and the
fourth, the data you wish to have passed to this function.

The function specified in the third argument is called a "callback
function", and should generally be of the form

<tscreen><verb>
void callback_func( GtkWidget *widget,
                    gpointer   callback_data );
</verb></tscreen>

where the first argument will be a pointer to the widget that emitted
the signal, and the second a pointer to the data given as the last
argument to the gtk_signal_connect() function as shown above.

Note that the above form for a signal callback function declaration is
only a general guide, as some widget specific signals generate
different calling parameters. For example, the CList "select_row"
signal provides both row and column parameters.

Another call used in the <em>helloworld</em> example, is:

<tscreen><verb>
gint gtk_signal_connect_object( GtkObject     *object,
                                gchar         *name,
                                GtkSignalFunc  func,
                                GtkObject     *slot_object );
</verb></tscreen>

gtk_signal_connect_object() is the same as gtk_signal_connect() except
that the callback function only uses one argument, a pointer to a GTK
object. So when using this function to connect signals, the callback
should be of the form

<tscreen><verb>
void callback_func( GtkObject *object );
</verb></tscreen>

where the object is usually a widget. We usually don't setup callbacks
for gtk_signal_connect_object however. They are usually used to call a
GTK function that accepts a single widget or object as an argument, as
is the case in our <em>helloworld</em> example.

The purpose of having two functions to connect signals is simply to
allow the callbacks to have a different number of arguments. Many
functions in the GTK library accept only a single GtkWidget pointer as
an argument, so you want to use the gtk_signal_connect_object() for
these, whereas for your functions, you may need to have additional
data supplied to the callbacks.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Events
<p>
In addition to the signal mechanism described above, there is a set
of <em>events</em> that reflect the X event mechanism. Callbacks may
also be attached to these events. These events are:

<itemize>
<item> event
<item> button_press_event
<item> button_release_event
<item> motion_notify_event
<item> delete_event
<item> destroy_event
<item> expose_event
<item> key_press_event
<item> key_release_event
<item> enter_notify_event
<item> leave_notify_event
<item> configure_event
<item> focus_in_event
<item> focus_out_event
<item> map_event
<item> unmap_event
<item> property_notify_event
<item> selection_clear_event
<item> selection_request_event
<item> selection_notify_event
<item> proximity_in_event
<item> proximity_out_event
<item> drag_begin_event
<item> drag_request_event
<item> drag_end_event
<item> drop_enter_event
<item> drop_leave_event
<item> drop_data_available_event
<item> other_event
</itemize>

In order to connect a callback function to one of these events, you
use the function gtk_signal_connect, as described above, using one of
the above event names as the <tt/name/ parameter. The callback
function for events has a slightly different form than that for
signals:

<tscreen><verb>
void callback_func( GtkWidget *widget,
                    GdkEvent  *event,
                    gpointer   callback_data );
</verb></tscreen>

GdkEvent is a C <tt/union/ structure whose type will depend upon which
of the above events has occurred. In order for us to tell which event
has been issued each of the possible alternatives has a <tt/type/
parameter which reflects the event being issued. The other components
of the event structure will depend upon the type of the
event. Possible values for the type are:

<tscreen><verb>
  GDK_NOTHING
  GDK_DELETE
  GDK_DESTROY
  GDK_EXPOSE
  GDK_MOTION_NOTIFY
  GDK_BUTTON_PRESS
  GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS
  GDK_3BUTTON_PRESS
  GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE
  GDK_KEY_PRESS
  GDK_KEY_RELEASE
  GDK_ENTER_NOTIFY
  GDK_LEAVE_NOTIFY
  GDK_FOCUS_CHANGE
  GDK_CONFIGURE
  GDK_MAP
  GDK_UNMAP
  GDK_PROPERTY_NOTIFY
  GDK_SELECTION_CLEAR
  GDK_SELECTION_REQUEST
  GDK_SELECTION_NOTIFY
  GDK_PROXIMITY_IN
  GDK_PROXIMITY_OUT
  GDK_DRAG_BEGIN
  GDK_DRAG_REQUEST
  GDK_DROP_ENTER
  GDK_DROP_LEAVE
  GDK_DROP_DATA_AVAIL
  GDK_CLIENT_EVENT
  GDK_VISIBILITY_NOTIFY
  GDK_NO_EXPOSE
  GDK_OTHER_EVENT	/* Deprecated, use filters instead */
</verb></tscreen>

So, to connect a callback function to one of these events we would use
something like:

<tscreen><verb>
gtk_signal_connect( GTK_OBJECT(button), "button_press_event",
                    GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC(button_press_callback), 
		    NULL);
</verb></tscreen>

This assumes that <tt/button/ is a Button widget. Now, when the
mouse is over the button and a mouse button is pressed, the function
<tt/button_press_callback/ will be called. This function may be
declared as:

<tscreen><verb>
static gint button_press_callback( GtkWidget      *widget, 
                                   GdkEventButton *event,
                                   gpointer        data );
</verb></tscreen>

Note that we can declare the second argument as type
<tt/GdkEventButton/ as we know what type of event will occur for this
function to be called.

The value returned from this function indicates whether the event
should be propagated further by the GTK event handling
mechanism. Returning TRUE indicates that the event has been handled,
and that it should not propagate further. Returning FALSE continues
the normal event handling.  See the section on
<ref id="sec_Adv_Events_and_Signals"
name="Advanced Event and Signal Handling"> for more details on this
propagation process.

For details on the GdkEvent data types, see the appendix entitled
<ref id="sec_GDK_Event_Types" name="GDK Event Types">.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Stepping Through Hello World
<p>
Now that we know the theory behind this, let's clarify by walking
through the example <em>helloworld</em> program.

Here is the callback function that will be called when the button is
"clicked". We ignore both the widget and the data in this example, but
it is not hard to do things with them. The next example will use the
data argument to tell us which button was pressed.

<tscreen><verb>
void hello( GtkWidget *widget,
            gpointer   data )
{
    g_print ("Hello World\n");
}
</verb></tscreen>

The next callback is a bit special. The "delete_event" occurs when the
window manager sends this event to the application. We have a choice
here as to what to do about these events. We can ignore them, make
some sort of response, or simply quit the application.

The value you return in this callback lets GTK know what action to
take.  By returning TRUE, we let it know that we don't want to have
the "destroy" signal emitted, keeping our application running. By
returning FALSE, we ask that "destroy" be emitted, which in turn will
call our "destroy" signal handler.

<tscreen><verb>
gint delete_event( GtkWidget *widget,
                   GdkEvent  *event,
		   gpointer   data )
{
    g_print ("delete event occurred\n");

    return (TRUE); 
}
</verb></tscreen>

Here is another callback function which causes the program to quit by
calling gtk_main_quit(). This function tells GTK that it is to exit
from gtk_main when control is returned to it.

<tscreen><verb>
void destroy( GtkWidget *widget,
              gpointer   data )
{
    gtk_main_quit ();
}
</verb></tscreen>

I assume you know about the main() function... yes, as with other
applications, all GTK applications will also have one of these.

<tscreen><verb>
int main( int   argc,
          char *argv[] )
{
</verb></tscreen>

This next part declares pointers to a structure of type
GtkWidget. These are used below to create a window and a button.

<tscreen><verb>
    GtkWidget *window;
    GtkWidget *button;
</verb></tscreen>

Here is our gtk_init again. As before, this initializes the toolkit,
and parses the arguments found on the command line. Any argument it
recognizes from the command line, it removes from the list, and
modifies argc and argv to make it look like they never existed,
allowing your application to parse the remaining arguments.

<tscreen><verb>
    gtk_init (&amp;argc, &amp;argv);
</verb></tscreen>

Create a new window. This is fairly straightforward. Memory is
allocated for the GtkWidget *window structure so it now points to a
valid structure. It sets up a new window, but it is not displayed
until we call gtk_widget_show(window) near the end of our program.

<tscreen><verb>
    window = gtk_window_new (GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
</verb></tscreen>

Here are two examples of connecting a signal handler to an object, in
this case, the window. Here, the "delete_event" and "destroy" signals
are caught. The first is emitted when we use the window manager to
kill the window, or when we use the gtk_widget_destroy() call passing
in the window widget as the object to destroy. The second is emitted
when, in the "delete_event" handler, we return FALSE.
 
The <tt/GTK_OBJECT/ and <tt/GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC/ are macros that perform
type casting and checking for us, as well as aid the readability of
the code.

<tscreen><verb>
    gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT (window), "delete_event",
                        GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (delete_event), NULL);
    gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT (window), "destroy",
                        GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (destroy), NULL);
</verb></tscreen>

This next function is used to set an attribute of a container object.
This just sets the window so it has a blank area along the inside of
it 10 pixels wide where no widgets will go. There are other similar
functions which we will look at in the section on
<ref id="sec_setting_widget_attributes" name="Setting Widget Attributes">

And again, <tt/GTK_CONTAINER/ is a macro to perform type casting.

<tscreen><verb>
    gtk_container_set_border_width (GTK_CONTAINER (window), 10);
</verb></tscreen>

This call creates a new button. It allocates space for a new GtkWidget
structure in memory, initializes it, and makes the button pointer
point to it. It will have the label "Hello World" on it when
displayed.

<tscreen><verb>
    button = gtk_button_new_with_label ("Hello World");
</verb></tscreen>

Here, we take this button, and make it do something useful. We attach
a signal handler to it so when it emits the "clicked" signal, our
hello() function is called. The data is ignored, so we simply pass in
NULL to the hello() callback function. Obviously, the "clicked" signal
is emitted when we click the button with our mouse pointer.

<tscreen><verb>
    gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT (button), "clicked",
                        GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (hello), NULL);
</verb></tscreen>

We are also going to use this button to exit our program. This will
illustrate how the "destroy" signal may come from either the window
manager, or our program. When the button is "clicked", same as above,
it calls the first hello() callback function, and then this one in the
order they are set up. You may have as many callback functions as you
need, and all will be executed in the order you connected
them. Because the gtk_widget_destroy() function accepts only a
GtkWidget *widget as an argument, we use the
gtk_signal_connect_object() function here instead of straight
gtk_signal_connect().

<tscreen><verb>
    gtk_signal_connect_object (GTK_OBJECT (button), "clicked",
                               GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (gtk_widget_destroy),
                               GTK_OBJECT (window));
</verb></tscreen>

This is a packing call, which will be explained in depth later on in
<ref id="sec_packing_widgets" name="Packing Widgets">. But it is
fairly easy to understand. It simply tells GTK that the button is to
be placed in the window where it will be displayed. Note that a GTK
container can only contain one widget. There are other widgets, that
are described later, which are designed to layout multiple widgets in
various ways.
 
<tscreen><verb>
    gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (window), button);
</verb></tscreen>

Now we have everything set up the way we want it to be. With all the
signal handlers in place, and the button placed in the window where it
should be, we ask GTK to "show" the widgets on the screen. The window
widget is shown last so the whole window will pop up at once rather
than seeing the window pop up, and then the button form inside of
it. Although with such a simple example, you'd never notice.

<tscreen><verb>
    gtk_widget_show (button);

    gtk_widget_show (window);
</verb></tscreen>

And of course, we call gtk_main() which waits for events to come from
the X server and will call on the widgets to emit signals when these
events come.

<tscreen><verb>
    gtk_main ();
</verb></tscreen>

And the final return. Control returns here after gtk_quit() is called.

<tscreen><verb>
    return (0);
</verb></tscreen>

Now, when we click the mouse button on a GTK button, the widget emits
a "clicked" signal. In order for us to use this information, our
program sets up a signal handler to catch that signal, which
dispatches the function of our choice. In our example, when the button
we created is "clicked", the hello() function is called with a NULL
argument, and then the next handler for this signal is called. This
calls the gtk_widget_destroy() function, passing it the window widget
as its argument, destroying the window widget. This causes the window
to emit the "destroy" signal, which is caught, and calls our destroy()
callback function, which simply exits GTK.

Another course of events is to use the window manager to kill the
window, which will cause the "delete_event" to be emitted. This will
call our "delete_event" handler. If we return TRUE here, the window
will be left as is and nothing will happen. Returning FALSE will cause
GTK to emit the "destroy" signal which of course calls the "destroy"
callback, exiting GTK.

<sect1>Data Types
<p>
There are a few things you probably noticed in the previous examples
that need explaining. The gint, gchar, etc. that you see are typedefs
to int and char, respectively, that are part of the GLlib system. This
is done to get around that nasty dependency on the size of simple data
types when doing calculations.

A good example is "gint32" which will be typedef'd to a 32 bit integer
for any given platform, whether it be the 64 bit alpha, or the 32 bit
i386. The typedefs are very straightforward and intuitive. They are
all defined in glib/glib.h (which gets included from gtk.h).

You'll also notice GTK's ability to use GtkWidget when the function
calls for an Object. GTK is an object oriented design, and a widget
is an object.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>More on Signal Handlers
<p>
Lets take another look at the gtk_signal_connect declaration.

<tscreen><verb>
gint gtk_signal_connect( GtkObject *object,
                         gchar *name,
                         GtkSignalFunc func,
                         gpointer func_data );
</verb></tscreen>

Notice the gint return value? This is a tag that identifies your
callback function. As stated above, you may have as many callbacks per
signal and per object as you need, and each will be executed in turn,
in the order they were attached.

This tag allows you to remove this callback from the list by using:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_signal_disconnect( GtkObject *object,
                            gint id );
</verb></tscreen>

So, by passing in the widget you wish to remove the handler from, and
the tag returned by one of the signal_connect functions, you can
disconnect a signal handler.

You can also temporarily disable signal handlers with the
gtk_signal_handler_block() and gtk_signal_handler_unblock() family of
functions.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_signal_handler_block( GtkObject *object,
                               guint      handler_id );

void gtk_signal_handler_block_by_func( GtkObject     *object,
                                       GtkSignalFunc  func,
                                       gpointer       data );

void gtk_signal_handler_block_by_data( GtkObject *object,
                                       gpointer   data );

void gtk_signal_handler_unblock( GtkObject *object,
                                 guint      handler_id );

void gtk_signal_handler_unblock_by_func( GtkObject     *object,
                                         GtkSignalFunc  func,
                                         gpointer       data );

void gtk_signal_handler_unblock_by_data( GtkObject *object,
                                         gpointer   data);

Compile this program using the same linking arguments as our first
example.  You'll notice this time there is no easy way to exit the
program, you have to use your window manager or command line to kill
it. A good exercise for the reader would be to insert a third "Quit"
button that will exit the program. You may also wish to play with the
options to gtk_box_pack_start() while reading the next section.  Try
resizing the window, and observe the behavior.

Just as a side note, there is another useful define for
gtk_window_new() - <tt/GTK_WINDOW_DIALOG/. This interacts with the
window manager a little differently and should be used for transient
windows.

<!-- ***************************************************************** -->
<sect>Packing Widgets <label id="sec_packing_widgets">
<!-- ***************************************************************** -->
<p>
When creating an application, you'll want to put more than one widget
inside a window. Our first <em>helloworld</em> example only used one
widget so we could simply use a gtk_container_add call to "pack" the
widget into the window. But when you want to put more than one widget
into a window, how do you control where that widget is positioned?
This is where packing comes in.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Theory of Packing Boxes
<p>
Most packing is done by creating boxes as in the example above. These
are invisible widget containers that we can pack our widgets into
which come in two forms, a horizontal box, and a vertical box. When
packing widgets into a horizontal box, the objects are inserted
horizontally from left to right or right to left depending on the call
used. In a vertical box, widgets are packed from top to bottom or vice
versa. You may use any combination of boxes inside or beside other
boxes to create the desired effect.

To create a new horizontal box, we use a call to gtk_hbox_new(), and
for vertical boxes, gtk_vbox_new(). The gtk_box_pack_start() and
gtk_box_pack_end() functions are used to place objects inside of these
containers. The gtk_box_pack_start() function will start at the top
and work its way down in a vbox, and pack left to right in an hbox.
gtk_box_pack_end() will do the opposite, packing from bottom to top in
a vbox, and right to left in an hbox. Using these functions allows us
to right justify or left justify our widgets and may be mixed in any
way to achieve the desired effect. We will use gtk_box_pack_start() in
most of our examples. An object may be another container or a
widget. In fact, many widgets are actually containers themselves,
including the button, but we usually only use a label inside a button.

By using these calls, GTK knows where you want to place your widgets
so it can do automatic resizing and other nifty things. There are also
a number of options as to how your widgets should be packed. As you
can imagine, this method gives us a quite a bit of flexibility when
placing and creating widgets.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Details of Boxes
<p>
Because of this flexibility, packing boxes in GTK can be confusing at
first. There are a lot of options, and it's not immediately obvious how
they all fit together. In the end, however, there are basically five
different styles.

<? <CENTER> >
<?
<IMG SRC="gtk_tut_packbox1.gif" VSPACE="15" HSPACE="10" WIDTH="528"
HEIGHT="235" ALT="Box Packing Example Image">
>
<? </CENTER> >

Each line contains one horizontal box (hbox) with several buttons. The
call to gtk_box_pack is shorthand for the call to pack each of the
buttons into the hbox. Each of the buttons is packed into the hbox the
same way (i.e., same arguments to the gtk_box_pack_start() function).

This is the declaration of the gtk_box_pack_start function.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_box_pack_start( GtkBox    *box,
                         GtkWidget *child,
                         gint       expand,
                         gint       fill,
                         gint       padding );
</verb></tscreen>

The first argument is the box you are packing the object into, the
second is the object. The objects will all be buttons for now, so
we'll be packing buttons into boxes.

The expand argument to gtk_box_pack_start() and gtk_box_pack_end()
controls whether the widgets are laid out in the box to fill in all
the extra space in the box so the box is expanded to fill the area
allotted to it (TRUE); or the box is shrunk to just fit the widgets
(FALSE). Setting expand to FALSE will allow you to do right and left
justification of your widgets.  Otherwise, they will all expand to fit
into the box, and the same effect could be achieved by using only one
of gtk_box_pack_start or gtk_box_pack_end.

The fill argument to the gtk_box_pack functions control whether the
extra space is allocated to the objects themselves (TRUE), or as extra
padding in the box around these objects (FALSE). It only has an effect
if the expand argument is also TRUE.

When creating a new box, the function looks like this:

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_hbox_new (gint homogeneous,
                         gint spacing);
</verb></tscreen>

The homogeneous argument to gtk_hbox_new (and the same for
gtk_vbox_new) controls whether each object in the box has the same
size (i.e., the same width in an hbox, or the same height in a
vbox). If it is set, the gtk_box_pack routines function essentially
as if the <tt/expand/ argument was always turned on.

What's the difference between spacing (set when the box is created)
and padding (set when elements are packed)? Spacing is added between
objects, and padding is added on either side of an object. The
following figure should make it clearer:

<? <CENTER> >
<?
<IMG ALIGN="center" SRC="gtk_tut_packbox2.gif" WIDTH="509"
HEIGHT="213" VSPACE="15" HSPACE="10"
ALT="Box Packing Example Image">

<? </CENTER> >

Here is the code used to create the above images. I've commented it
fairly heavily so I hope you won't have any problems following
it. Compile it yourself and play with it.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Packing Using Tables
<p>
Let's take a look at another way of packing - Tables. These can be
extremely useful in certain situations.

Using tables, we create a grid that we can place widgets in. The
widgets may take up as many spaces as we specify.

The first thing to look at, of course, is the gtk_table_new function:

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_table_new( gint rows,
                          gint columns,
                          gint homogeneous );
</verb></tscreen>

The first argument is the number of rows to make in the table, while
the second, obviously, is the number of columns.

The homogeneous argument has to do with how the table's boxes are
sized. If homogeneous is TRUE, the table boxes are resized to the size
of the largest widget in the table. If homogeneous is FALSE, the size
of a table boxes is dictated by the tallest widget in its same row,
and the widest widget in its column.

The rows and columns are laid out from 0 to n, where n was the number
specified in the call to gtk_table_new. So, if you specify rows = 2
and columns = 2, the layout would look something like this:

<tscreen><verb>
 0          1          2
0+----------+----------+
 |          |          |
1+----------+----------+
 |          |          |
2+----------+----------+
</verb></tscreen>

Note that the coordinate system starts in the upper left hand corner.
To place a widget into a box, use the following function:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_table_attach( GtkTable  *table,
                       GtkWidget *child,
                       gint       left_attach,
                       gint       right_attach,
                       gint       top_attach,
                       gint       bottom_attach,
                       gint       xoptions,
                       gint       yoptions,
                       gint       xpadding,
                       gint       ypadding );
</verb></tscreen>				       

The first argument ("table") is the table you've created and the
second ("child") the widget you wish to place in the table.

The left and right attach arguments specify where to place the widget,
and how many boxes to use. If you want a button in the lower right
table entry of our 2x2 table, and want it to fill that entry ONLY,
left_attach would be = 1, right_attach = 2, top_attach = 1,
bottom_attach = 2.

Now, if you wanted a widget to take up the whole top row of our 2x2
table, you'd use left_attach = 0, right_attach = 2, top_attach = 0,
bottom_attach = 1.

The xoptions and yoptions are used to specify packing options and may
be bitwise OR'ed together to allow multiple options.

These options are:
<itemize>
<item><tt/GTK_FILL/ - If the table box is larger than the widget, and
<tt/GTK_FILL/ is specified, the widget will expand to use all the room
available.

<item><tt/GTK_SHRINK/ - If the table widget was allocated less space
then was requested (usually by the user resizing the window), then the
widgets would normally just be pushed off the bottom of the window and
disappear. If <tt/GTK_SHRINK/ is specified, the widgets will shrink
with the table.

<item><tt/GTK_EXPAND/ - This will cause the table to expand to use up
any remaining space in the window.
</itemize>

Padding is just like in boxes, creating a clear area around the widget
specified in pixels.

gtk_table_attach() has a LOT of options.  So, there's a shortcut:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_table_attach_defaults( GtkTable  *table,
                                GtkWidget *widget,
                                gint       left_attach,
                                gint       right_attach,
                                gint       top_attach,
                                gint       bottom_attach );
</verb></tscreen>

The X and Y options default to <tt/GTK_FILL | GTK_EXPAND/, and X and Y
padding are set to 0. The rest of the arguments are identical to the
previous function.

We also have gtk_table_set_row_spacing() and
gtk_table_set_col_spacing(). These places spacing between the rows at
the specified row or column.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_table_set_row_spacing( GtkTable *table,
                                gint      row,
                                gint      spacing );
</verb></tscreen>

and

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_table_set_col_spacing ( GtkTable *table,
                                 gint      column,
                                 gint      spacing );
</verb></tscreen>

Note that for columns, the space goes to the right of the column, and
for rows, the space goes below the row.

You can also set a consistent spacing of all rows and/or columns with:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_table_set_row_spacings( GtkTable *table,
                                 gint      spacing );
</verb></tscreen>

And,

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_table_set_col_spacings( GtkTable *table,
                                 gint      spacing );
</verb></tscreen>

Note that with these calls, the last row and last column do not get
any spacing.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Table Packing Example
<p>
Here we make a window with three buttons in a 2x2 table.
The first two buttons will be placed in the upper row.
A third, quit button, is placed in the lower row, spanning both columns.
Which means it should look something like this:

<!-- ***************************************************************** -->
<sect>Widget Overview
<!-- ***************************************************************** -->
<p>
The general steps to creating a widget in GTK are:
<enum>
<item> gtk_*_new - one of various functions to create a new widget.
These are all detailed in this section.

<item> Connect all signals and events we wish to use to the
appropriate handlers.

<item> Set the attributes of the widget.

<item> Pack the widget into a container using the appropriate call
such as gtk_container_add() or gtk_box_pack_start().

<item> gtk_widget_show() the widget.
</enum>

gtk_widget_show() lets GTK know that we are done setting the
attributes of the widget, and it is ready to be displayed. You may
also use gtk_widget_hide to make it disappear again. The order in
which you show the widgets is not important, but I suggest showing the
window last so the whole window pops up at once rather than seeing the
individual widgets come up on the screen as they're formed. The
children of a widget (a window is a widget too) will not be displayed
until the window itself is shown using the gtk_widget_show() function.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1> Casting
<p>
You'll notice as you go on that GTK uses a type casting system. This
is always done using macros that both test the ability to cast the
given item, and perform the cast. Some common ones you will see are:

<tscreen><verb>
  GTK_WIDGET(widget)
  GTK_OBJECT(object)
  GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC(function)
  GTK_CONTAINER(container)
  GTK_WINDOW(window)
  GTK_BOX(box)
</verb></tscreen>

These are all used to cast arguments in functions. You'll see them in the
examples, and can usually tell when to use them simply by looking at the
function's declaration.

As you can see below in the class hierarchy, all GtkWidgets are
derived from the Object base class. This means you can use a widget
in any place the function asks for an object - simply use the
<tt/GTK_OBJECT()/ macro.

For example:

<tscreen><verb>
gtk_signal_connect( GTK_OBJECT(button), "clicked",
                    GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC(callback_function), callback_data);
</verb></tscreen> 

This casts the button into an object, and provides a cast for the
function pointer to the callback.

Many widgets are also containers. If you look in the class hierarchy
below, you'll notice that many widgets derive from the Container
class. Any one of these widgets may be used with the
<tt/GTK_CONTAINER/ macro to pass them to functions that ask for
containers.

Unfortunately, these macros are not extensively covered in the
tutorial, but I recommend taking a look through the GTK header
files. It can be very educational. In fact, it's not difficult to
learn how a widget works just by looking at the function declarations.

We'll further our exploration of GTK by examining each widget in turn,

is the testgtk.c program that comes with GTK. It can be found in
gtk/testgtk.c.

<!-- ***************************************************************** -->
<sect>The Button Widget
<!-- ***************************************************************** -->

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Normal Buttons
<p>
We've almost seen all there is to see of the button widget. It's
pretty simple. There are however two ways to create a button. You can
use the gtk_button_new_with_label() to create a button with a label,
or use gtk_button_new() to create a blank button. It's then up to you
to pack a label or pixmap into this new button. To do this, create a
new box, and then pack your objects into this box using the usual
gtk_box_pack_start, and then use gtk_container_add to pack the box
into the button.

Here's an example of using gtk_button_new to create a button with a
picture and a label in it. I've broken up the code to create a box
from the rest so you can use it in your programs. There are further
examples of using pixmaps later in the tutorial.

<tscreen><verb>
/* example-start buttons buttons.c */

#include <gtk/gtk.h>

/* Create a new hbox with an image and a label packed into it
 * and return the box. */

GtkWidget *xpm_label_box( GtkWidget *parent,
                          gchar     *xpm_filename,
                          gchar     *label_text )
{
    GtkWidget *box1;
    GtkWidget *label;
    GtkWidget *pixmapwid;
    GdkPixmap *pixmap;
    GdkBitmap *mask;
    GtkStyle *style;

    /* Create box for xpm and label */
    box1 = gtk_hbox_new (FALSE, 0);
    gtk_container_set_border_width (GTK_CONTAINER (box1), 2);

    /* Get the style of the button to get the
     * background color. */
    style = gtk_widget_get_style(parent);

    /* Now on to the xpm stuff */
    pixmap = gdk_pixmap_create_from_xpm (parent->window, &amp;mask,
					 &amp;style->bg[GTK_STATE_NORMAL],
					 xpm_filename);
    pixmapwid = gtk_pixmap_new (pixmap, mask);

    /* Create a label for the button */
    label = gtk_label_new (label_text);

    /* Pack the pixmap and label into the box */
    gtk_box_pack_start (GTK_BOX (box1),
			pixmapwid, FALSE, FALSE, 3);

    gtk_box_pack_start (GTK_BOX (box1), label, FALSE, FALSE, 3);

    gtk_widget_show(pixmapwid);
    gtk_widget_show(label);

    return(box1);
}

/* Our usual callback function */
void callback( GtkWidget *widget,
               gpointer   data )
{
    g_print ("Hello again - %s was pressed\n", (char *) data);
}


int main( int   argc,
          char *argv[] )
{
    /* GtkWidget is the storage type for widgets */
    GtkWidget *window;
    GtkWidget *button;
    GtkWidget *box1;

    gtk_init (&amp;argc, &amp;argv);

    /* Create a new window */
    window = gtk_window_new (GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);

    gtk_window_set_title (GTK_WINDOW (window), "Pixmap'd Buttons!");

    /* It's a good idea to do this for all windows. */
    gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT (window), "destroy",
			GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (gtk_exit), NULL);

    gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT (window), "delete_event",
			GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (gtk_exit), NULL);

    /* Sets the border width of the window. */
    gtk_container_set_border_width (GTK_CONTAINER (window), 10);
    gtk_widget_realize(window);

    /* Create a new button */
    button = gtk_button_new ();

    /* Connect the "clicked" signal of the button to our callback */
    gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT (button), "clicked",
			GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (callback), (gpointer) "cool button");

    /* This calls our box creating function */
    box1 = xpm_label_box(window, "info.xpm", "cool button");

    /* Pack and show all our widgets */
    gtk_widget_show(box1);

    gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (button), box1);

    gtk_widget_show(button);

    gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (window), button);

    gtk_widget_show (window);

    /* Rest in gtk_main and wait for the fun to begin! */
    gtk_main ();

    return(0);
}
/* example-end */
</verb></tscreen>

The xpm_label_box function could be used to pack xpm's and labels into
any widget that can be a container.

Notice in <tt/xpm_label_box/ how there is a call to
<tt/gtk_widget_get_style/. Every widget has a "style", consisting of
foreground and background colors for a variety of situations, font
selection, and other graphics data relevant to a widget. These style
values are defaulted in each widget, and are required by many GDK
function calls, such as <tt/gdk_pixmap_create_from_xpm/, which here is
given the "normal" background color. The style data of widgets may
be customized, using <ref id="sec_gtkrc_files" name="GTK's rc files">.

Also notice the call to <tt/gtk_widget_realize/ after setting the
window's border width. This function uses GDK to create the X
windows related to the widget. The function is automatically called
when you invoke <tt/gtk_widget_show/ for a widget, and so has not been
shown in earlier examples. But the call to
<tt/gdk_pixmap_create_from_xpm/ requires that its <tt/window/ argument
refer to a real X window, so it is necessary to realize the widget
before this GDK call.

The Button widget has the following signals:

<itemize>
<item><tt/pressed/ - emitted when pointer button is pressed within
Button widget
<item><tt/released/ - emitted when pointer button is released within
Button widget
<item><tt/clicked/ - emitted when pointer button is pressed and then
released within Button widget
<item><tt/enter/ - emitted when pointer enters Button widget
<item><tt/leave/ - emitted when pointer leaves Button widget
</itemize>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1> Toggle Buttons
<p>
Toggle buttons are derived from normal buttons and are very similar,
except they will always be in one of two states, alternated by a
click. They may be depressed, and when you click again, they will pop
back up. Click again, and they will pop back down.

Toggle buttons are the basis for check buttons and radio buttons, as
such, many of the calls used for toggle buttons are inherited by radio
and check buttons. I will point these out when we come to them.

Creating a new toggle button:

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_toggle_button_new( void );

GtkWidget *gtk_toggle_button_new_with_label( gchar *label );
</verb></tscreen>

As you can imagine, these work identically to the normal button widget
calls. The first creates a blank toggle button, and the second, a
button with a label widget already packed into it.

To retrieve the state of the toggle widget, including radio and check
buttons, we use a construct as shown in our example below. This tests
the state of the toggle, by accessing the <tt/active/ field of the
toggle widget's structure, after first using the
<tt/GTK_TOGGLE_BUTTON/ macro to cast the widget pointer into a toggle
widget pointer. The signal of interest to us emitted by toggle
buttons (the toggle button, check button, and radio button widgets) is
the "toggled" signal. To check the state of these buttons, set up a
signal handler to catch the toggled signal, and access the structure
to determine its state. The callback will look something like:

<tscreen><verb>
void toggle_button_callback (GtkWidget *widget, gpointer data)
{
    if (GTK_TOGGLE_BUTTON (widget)->active) 
    {
        /* If control reaches here, the toggle button is down */
    
    } else {
    
        /* If control reaches here, the toggle button is up */
    }
}
</verb></tscreen>

To force the state of a toggle button, and its children, the radio and
check buttons, use this function:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_toggle_button_set_active( GtkToggleButton *toggle_button,
                                  gint             state );
</verb></tscreen>

The above call can be used to set the state of the toggle button, and
its children the radio and check buttons. Passing in your created
button as the first argument, and a TRUE or FALSE for the second state
argument to specify whether it should be down (depressed) or up
(released). Default is up, or FALSE.

Note that when you use the gtk_toggle_button_set_active() function, and
the state is actually changed, it causes the "clicked" signal to be
emitted from the button.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_toggle_button_toggled (GtkToggleButton *toggle_button);
</verb></tscreen>

This simply toggles the button, and emits the "toggled" signal.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1> Check Buttons
<p>
Check buttons inherit many properties and functions from the the
toggle buttons above, but look a little different. Rather than being
buttons with text inside them, they are small squares with the text to
the right of them. These are often used for toggling options on and
off in applications.

The two creation functions are similar to those of the normal button.

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_check_button_new( void );

GtkWidget *gtk_check_button_new_with_label ( gchar *label );
</verb></tscreen>

The new_with_label function creates a check button with a label beside
it.

Checking the state of the check button is identical to that of the
toggle button.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1> Radio Buttons <label id="sec_Radio_Buttons">
<p>
Radio buttons are similar to check buttons except they are grouped so
that only one may be selected/depressed at a time. This is good for
places in your application where you need to select from a short list
of options.

Creating a new radio button is done with one of these calls:

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_radio_button_new( GSList *group );

GtkWidget *gtk_radio_button_new_with_label( GSList *group,
                                            gchar  *label );
</verb></tscreen>

You'll notice the extra argument to these calls. They require a group
to perform their duty properly. The first call to
gtk_radio_button_new_with_label or gtk_radio_button_new_with_label
should pass NULL as the first argument. Then create a group using:

<tscreen><verb>
GSList *gtk_radio_button_group( GtkRadioButton *radio_button );
</verb></tscreen>

The important thing to remember is that gtk_radio_button_group must be
called for each new button added to the group, with the previous
button passed in as an argument. The result is then passed into the
next call to gtk_radio_button_new or
gtk_radio_button_new_with_label. This allows a chain of buttons to be
established. The example below should make this clear.

You can shorten this slightly by using the following syntax, which
removes the need for a variable to hold the list of buttons. This form
is used in the example to create the third button:

<tscreen><verb>
     button2 = gtk_radio_button_new_with_label(
                 gtk_radio_button_group (GTK_RADIO_BUTTON (button1)),
                 "button2");
</verb></tscreen>

It is also a good idea to explicitly set which button should be the
default depressed button with:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_toggle_button_set_active( GtkToggleButton *toggle_button,
                                  gint             state );
</verb></tscreen>

This is described in the section on toggle buttons, and works in
exactly the same way.  Once the radio buttons are grouped together,
only one of the group may be active at a time. If the user clicks on
one radio button, and then on another, the first radio button will
first emit a "toggled" signal (to report becoming inactive), and then
the second will emit its "toggled" signal (to report becoming active).

The following example creates a radio button group with three buttons.

<tscreen><verb>
/* example-start radiobuttons radiobuttons.c */

#include <gtk/gtk.h>
#include <glib.h>

gint close_application( GtkWidget *widget,

<!-- ***************************************************************** -->
<sect> Adjustments <label id="sec_Adjustment">
<!-- ***************************************************************** -->
<p>
GTK has various widgets that can be visually adjusted by the user
using the mouse or the keyboard, such as the range widgets, described
in the <ref id="sec_Range_Widgets" name="Range Widgets">
section. There are also a few widgets that display some adjustable
portion of a larger area of data, such as the text widget and the
viewport widget.

Obviously, an application needs to be able to react to changes the
user makes in range widgets. One way to do this would be to have each
widget emit its own type of signal when its adjustment changes, and
either pass the new value to the signal handler, or require it to look
inside the widget's data structure in order to ascertain the value.
But you may also want to connect the adjustments of several widgets
together, so that adjusting one adjusts the others. The most obvious
example of this is connecting a scrollbar to a panning viewport or a
scrolling text area. If each widget has its own way of setting or
getting the adjustment value, then the programmer may have to write
their own signal handlers to translate between the output of one
widget's signal and the "input" of another's adjustment setting
function.

GTK solves this problem using the Adjustment object, which is not a
widget but a way for widgets to store and pass adjustment information
in an abstract and flexible form. The most obvious use of Adjustment
is to store the configuration parameters and values of range widgets,
such as scrollbars and scale controls. However, since Adjustments are
derived from Object, they have some special powers beyond those of
normal data structures. Most importantly, they can emit signals, just
like widgets, and these signals can be used not only to allow your
program to react to user input on adjustable widgets, but also to
propagate adjustment values transparently between adjustable widgets.

You will see how adjustments fit in when you see the other widgets
that incorporate them:
<ref id="sec_ProgressBar" name="Progress Bars">,
<ref id="sec_Viewports" name="Viewports">,
<ref id="sec_ScrolledWindow" name="Scrolled Windows">, and others.

<sect1> Creating an Adjustment
<p>
Many of the widgets which use adjustment objects do so automatically,
but some cases will be shown in later examples where you may need to
create one yourself. You create an adjustment using:

<tscreen><verb>
GtkObject *gtk_adjustment_new( gfloat value,
                               gfloat lower,
                               gfloat upper,
                               gfloat step_increment,
                               gfloat page_increment,
                               gfloat page_size );
</verb></tscreen>

The <tt/value/ argument is the initial value you want to give to the
adjustment, usually corresponding to the topmost or leftmost position
of an adjustable widget. The <tt/lower/ argument specifies the lowest
value which the adjustment can hold. The <tt/step_increment/ argument
specifies the "smaller" of the two increments by which the user can
change the value, while the <tt/page_increment/ is the "larger" one.
The <tt/page_size/ argument usually corresponds somehow to the visible
area of a panning widget. The <tt/upper/ argument is used to represent
the bottom most or right most coordinate in a panning widget's
child. Therefore it is <em/not/ always the largest number that
<tt/value/ can take, since the <tt/page_size/ of such widgets is
usually non-zero.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1> Using Adjustments the Easy Way
<p>
The adjustable widgets can be roughly divided into those which use and
require specific units for these values and those which treat them as
arbitrary numbers. The group which treats the values as arbitrary
numbers includes the range widgets (scrollbars and scales, the
progress bar widget, and the spin button widget). These widgets are
all the widgets which are typically "adjusted" directly by the user
with the mouse or keyboard. They will treat the <tt/lower/ and
<tt/upper/ values of an adjustment as a range within which the user
can manipulate the adjustment's <tt/value/. By default, they will only
modify the <tt/value/ of an adjustment.

The other group includes the text widget, the viewport widget, the
compound list widget, and the scrolled window widget. All of these
widgets use pixel values for their adjustments. These are also all
widgets which are typically "adjusted" indirectly using scrollbars.
While all widgets which use adjustments can either create their own
adjustments or use ones you supply, you'll generally want to let this
particular category of widgets create its own adjustments. Usually,
they will eventually override all the values except the <tt/value/
itself in whatever adjustments you give them, but the results are, in
general, undefined (meaning, you'll have to read the source code to
find out, and it may be different from widget to widget).

Now, you're probably thinking, since text widgets and viewports insist
on setting everything except the <tt/value/ of their adjustments,
while scrollbars will <em/only/ touch the adjustment's <tt/value/, if
you <em/share/ an adjustment object between a scrollbar and a text
widget, manipulating the scrollbar will automagically adjust the text
widget?  Of course it will! Just like this:

<tscreen><verb>
  /* creates its own adjustments */
  text = gtk_text_new (NULL, NULL);
  /* uses the newly-created adjustment for the scrollbar as well */
  vscrollbar = gtk_vscrollbar_new (GTK_TEXT(text)->vadj);
</verb></tscreen>

</sect1>
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1> Adjustment Internals
<p>
Ok, you say, that's nice, but what if I want to create my own handlers
to respond when the user adjusts a range widget or a spin button, and
how do I get at the value of the adjustment in these handlers?  To
answer these questions and more, let's start by taking a look at
<tt>struct _GtkAdjustment</tt> itself:

<tscreen><verb>
struct _GtkAdjustment
{
  GtkData data;
  
  gfloat lower;
  gfloat upper;
  gfloat value;
  gfloat step_increment;
  gfloat page_increment;
  gfloat page_size;
};     
</verb></tscreen>

The first thing you should know is that there aren't any handy-dandy
macros or accessor functions for getting the <tt/value/ out of an
Adjustment, so you'll have to (horror of horrors) do it like a
<em/real/ C programmer.  Don't worry - the <tt>GTK_ADJUSTMENT
(Object)</tt> macro does run-time type checking (as do all the GTK
type-casting macros, actually).

Since, when you set the <tt/value/ of an adjustment, you generally
want the change to be reflected by every widget that uses this
adjustment, GTK provides this convenience function to do this:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_adjustment_set_value( GtkAdjustment *adjustment,
                               gfloat         value );
</verb></tscreen>

As mentioned earlier, Adjustment is a subclass of Object just
like all the various widgets, and thus it is able to emit signals.
This is, of course, why updates happen automagically when you share an
adjustment object between a scrollbar and another adjustable widget;
all adjustable widgets connect signal handlers to their adjustment's
<tt/value_changed/ signal, as can your program. Here's the definition
of this signal in <tt/struct _GtkAdjustmentClass/:

<tscreen><verb>
  void (* value_changed) (GtkAdjustment *adjustment);
</verb></tscreen>

The various widgets that use the Adjustment object will emit this
signal on an adjustment whenever they change its value. This happens
both when user input causes the slider to move on a range widget, as
well as when the program explicitly changes the value with
<tt/gtk_adjustment_set_value()/. So, for example, if you have a scale
widget, and you want to change the rotation of a picture whenever its
value changes, you would create a callback like this:

<tscreen><verb>
void cb_rotate_picture (GtkAdjustment *adj, GtkWidget *picture)
{
  set_picture_rotation (picture, adj->value);
...
</verb></tscreen>

and connect it to the scale widget's adjustment like this:

<tscreen><verb>
gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT (adj), "value_changed",
	            GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (cb_rotate_picture), picture);
</verb></tscreen>

What about when a widget reconfigures the <tt/upper/ or <tt/lower/
fields of its adjustment, such as when a user adds more text to a text
widget?  In this case, it emits the <tt/changed/ signal, which looks
like this:

<tscreen><verb>
  void (* changed)	 (GtkAdjustment *adjustment);
</verb></tscreen>

Range widgets typically connect a handler to this signal, which
changes their appearance to reflect the change - for example, the size
of the slider in a scrollbar will grow or shrink in inverse proportion
to the difference between the <tt/lower/ and <tt/upper/ values of its
adjustment.

You probably won't ever need to attach a handler to this signal,
unless you're writing a new type of range widget.  However, if you
change any of the values in a Adjustment directly, you should emit
this signal on it to reconfigure whatever widgets are using it, like
this:

<tscreen><verb>
gtk_signal_emit_by_name (GTK_OBJECT (adjustment), "changed");
</verb></tscreen>

Now go forth and adjust!
</sect1>
</sect>

<!-- ***************************************************************** -->
<sect> Range Widgets<label id="sec_Range_Widgets">
<!-- ***************************************************************** -->

<p>
The category of range widgets includes the ubiquitous scrollbar widget
and the less common "scale" widget. Though these two types of widgets
are generally used for different purposes, they are quite similar in
function and implementation. All range widgets share a set of common
graphic elements, each of which has its own X window and receives
events. They all contain a "trough" and a "slider" (what is sometimes
called a "thumbwheel" in other GUI environments). Dragging the slider
with the pointer moves it back and forth within the trough, while
clicking in the trough advances the slider towards the location of the
click, either completely, or by a designated amount, depending on
which mouse button is used.

As mentioned in <ref id="sec_Adjustment" name="Adjustments"> above,
all range widgets are associated with an adjustment object, from which
they calculate the length of the slider and its position within the
trough. When the user manipulates the slider, the range widget will
change the value of the adjustment.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1> Scrollbar Widgets
<p>
These are your standard, run-of-the-mill scrollbars. These should be
used only for scrolling some other widget, such as a list, a text box,
or a viewport (and it's generally easier to use the scrolled window
widget in most cases).  For other purposes, you should use scale
widgets, as they are friendlier and more featureful.

There are separate types for horizontal and vertical scrollbars.
There really isn't much to say about these. You create them with the
following functions, defined in <tt>&lt;gtk/gtkhscrollbar.h&gt;</tt>
and <tt>&lt;gtk/gtkvscrollbar.h&gt;</tt>:

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_hscrollbar_new( GtkAdjustment *adjustment );

GtkWidget *gtk_vscrollbar_new( GtkAdjustment *adjustment );
</verb></tscreen>

and that's about it (if you don't believe me, look in the header
files!).  The <tt/adjustment/ argument can either be a pointer to an
existing Adjustment, or NULL, in which case one will be created for
you. Specifying NULL might actually be useful in this case, if you
wish to pass the newly-created adjustment to the constructor function
of some other widget which will configure it for you, such as a text
widget.
</sect1>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1> Scale Widgets
<p>
Scale widgets are used to allow the user to visually select and
manipulate a value within a specific range. You might want to use a
scale widget, for example, to adjust the magnification level on a
zoomed preview of a picture, or to control the brightness of a color,
or to specify the number of minutes of inactivity before a screensaver
takes over the screen.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect2>Creating a Scale Widget
<p>
As with scrollbars, there are separate widget types for horizontal and
vertical scale widgets. (Most programmers seem to favour horizontal
scale widgets.) Since they work essentially the same way, there's no
need to treat them separately here. The following functions, defined
in <tt>&lt;gtk/gtkvscale.h&gt;</tt> and
<tt>&lt;gtk/gtkhscale.h&gt;</tt>, create vertical and horizontal scale
widgets, respectively:

<tscreen>
<verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_vscale_new( GtkAdjustment *adjustment );

GtkWidget *gtk_hscale_new( GtkAdjustment *adjustment );
</verb>
</tscreen>

The <tt/adjustment/ argument can either be an adjustment which has
already been created with <tt/gtk_adjustment_new()/, or <tt/NULL/, in
which case, an anonymous Adjustment is created with all of its
values set to <tt/0.0/ (which isn't very useful in this case). In
order to avoid confusing yourself, you probably want to create your
adjustment with a <tt/page_size/ of <tt/0.0/ so that its <tt/upper/
value actually corresponds to the highest value the user can select.
(If you're <em/already/ thoroughly confused, read the section on <ref
id="sec_Adjustment" name="Adjustments"> again for an explanation of
what exactly adjustments do and how to create and manipulate them.)

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect2> Functions and Signals (well, functions, at least)
<p>
Scale widgets can display their current value as a number beside the
trough. The default behaviour is to show the value, but you can change
this with this function:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_scale_set_draw_value( GtkScale *scale,
                               gint      draw_value );
</verb></tscreen>

As you might have guessed, <tt/draw_value/ is either <tt/TRUE/ or
<tt/FALSE/, with predictable consequences for either one.

The value displayed by a scale widget is rounded to one decimal point
by default, as is the <tt/value/ field in its GtkAdjustment. You can
change this with:

<tscreen>
<verb>
void gtk_scale_set_digits( GtkScale *scale,
                            gint     digits );
</verb>
</tscreen>

where <tt/digits/ is the number of decimal places you want. You can
set <tt/digits/ to anything you like, but no more than 13 decimal
places will actually be drawn on screen.

Finally, the value can be drawn in different positions
relative to the trough:

<tscreen>
<verb>
void gtk_scale_set_value_pos( GtkScale        *scale,
                              GtkPositionType  pos );
</verb>
</tscreen>

The argument <tt/pos/ is of type <tt>GtkPositionType</tt>, which is
defined in <tt>&lt;gtk/gtkenums.h&gt;</tt>, and can take one of the
following values:

<tscreen><verb>
  GTK_POS_LEFT
  GTK_POS_RIGHT
  GTK_POS_TOP
  GTK_POS_BOTTOM
</verb></tscreen>

If you position the value on the "side" of the trough (e.g., on the
top or bottom of a horizontal scale widget), then it will follow the
slider up and down the trough.

All the preceding functions are defined in
<tt>&lt;gtk/gtkscale.h&gt;</tt>. The header files for all GTK widgets
are automatically included when you include
<tt>&lt;gtk/gtk.h&gt;</tt>. But you should look over the header files
of all widgets that interest you,

</sect2>
</sect1>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1> Common Range Functions <label id="sec_Range_Functions">
<p>
The Range widget class is fairly complicated internally, but, like
all the "base class" widgets, most of its complexity is only
interesting if you want to hack on it. Also, almost all of the
functions and signals it defines are only really used in writing
derived widgets. There are, however, a few useful functions that are
defined in <tt>&lt;gtk/gtkrange.h&gt;</tt> and will work on all range
widgets.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect2> Setting the Update Policy
<p>
The "update policy" of a range widget defines at what points during
user interaction it will change the <tt/value/ field of its
Adjustment and emit the "value_changed" signal on this
Adjustment. The update policies, defined in
<tt>&lt;gtk/gtkenums.h&gt;</tt> as type <tt>enum GtkUpdateType</tt>,
are:

<itemize>
<item>GTK_UPDATE_POLICY_CONTINUOUS - This is the default. The
"value_changed" signal is emitted continuously, i.e., whenever the
slider is moved by even the tiniest amount.
</item>
<item>GTK_UPDATE_POLICY_DISCONTINUOUS - The "value_changed" signal is
only emitted once the slider has stopped moving and the user has
released the mouse button.
</item>
<item>GTK_UPDATE_POLICY_DELAYED - The "value_changed" signal is emitted
when the user releases the mouse button, or if the slider stops moving
for a short period of time.
</item>
</itemize>

The update policy of a range widget can be set by casting it using the
<tt>GTK_RANGE (Widget)</tt> macro and passing it to this function:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_range_set_update_policy( GtkRange      *range,
	                          GtkUpdateType  policy) ;
</verb></tscreen>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect2>Getting and Setting Adjustments
<p>
Getting and setting the adjustment for a range widget "on the fly" is
done, predictably, with:

<tscreen><verb>
GtkAdjustment* gtk_range_get_adjustment( GtkRange *range );

void gtk_range_set_adjustment( GtkRange      *range,
                               GtkAdjustment *adjustment );
</verb></tscreen>

<tt/gtk_range_get_adjustment()/ returns a pointer to the adjustment to
which <tt/range/ is connected.

<tt/gtk_range_set_adjustment()/ does absolutely nothing if you pass it
the adjustment that <tt/range/ is already using, regardless of whether
you changed any of its fields or not. If you pass it a new
Adjustment, it will unreference the old one if it exists (possibly
destroying it), connect the appropriate signals to the new one, and
call the private function <tt/gtk_range_adjustment_changed()/, which
will (or at least, is supposed to...) recalculate the size and/or
position of the slider and redraw if necessary. As mentioned in the
section on adjustments, if you wish to reuse the same Adjustment,
when you modify its values directly, you should emit the "changed"
signal on it, like this:

<tscreen><verb>
gtk_signal_emit_by_name (GTK_OBJECT (adjustment), "changed");
</verb></tscreen>
</sect2>
</sect1>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1> Key and Mouse bindings
<p>
All of the GTK range widgets react to mouse clicks in more or less
the same way. Clicking button-1 in the trough will cause its
adjustment's <tt/page_increment/ to be added or subtracted from its
<tt/value/, and the slider to be moved accordingly. Clicking mouse
button-2 in the trough will jump the slider to the point at which the
button was clicked. Clicking any button on a scrollbar's arrows will
cause its adjustment's value to change <tt/step_increment/ at a time.

It may take a little while to get used to, but by default, scrollbars
as well as scale widgets can take the keyboard focus in GTK. If you
think your users will find this too confusing, you can always disable
this by unsetting the <tt/GTK_CAN_FOCUS/ flag on the scrollbar, like
this:

<tscreen><verb>
GTK_WIDGET_UNSET_FLAGS (scrollbar, GTK_CAN_FOCUS);
</verb></tscreen>

The key bindings (which are, of course, only active when the widget
has focus) are slightly different between horizontal and vertical
range widgets, for obvious reasons. They are also not quite the same
for scale widgets as they are for scrollbars, for somewhat less
obvious reasons (possibly to avoid confusion between the keys for
horizontal and vertical scrollbars in scrolled windows, where both
operate on the same area).

<sect2> Vertical Range Widgets
<p>
All vertical range widgets can be operated with the up and down arrow
keys, as well as with the <tt/Page Up/ and <tt/Page Down/ keys. The
arrows move the slider up and down by <tt/step_increment/, while
<tt/Page Up/ and <tt/Page Down/ move it by <tt/page_increment/.

The user can also move the slider all the way to one end or the other
of the trough using the keyboard. With the VScale widget, this is
done with the <tt/Home/ and <tt/End/ keys, whereas with the
VScrollbar widget, this is done by typing <tt>Control-Page Up</tt>
and <tt>Control-Page Down</tt>.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect2> Horizontal Range Widgets
<p>
The left and right arrow keys work as you might expect in these
widgets, moving the slider back and forth by <tt/step_increment/. The
<tt/Home/ and <tt/End/ keys move the slider to the ends of the trough.
For the HScale widget, moving the slider by <tt/page_increment/ is
accomplished with <tt>Control-Left</tt> and <tt>Control-Right</tt>,
while for HScrollbar, it's done with <tt>Control-Home</tt> and
<tt>Control-End</tt>.
</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1> Example<label id="sec_Range_Example">
<p>
This example is a somewhat modified version of the "range controls"
test from <tt/testgtk.c/. It basically puts up a window with three
range widgets all connected to the same adjustment, and a couple of
controls for adjusting some of the parameters mentioned above and in
the section on adjustments, so you can see how they affect the way
these widgets work for the user.

You will notice that the program does not call <tt/gtk_signal_connect/
for the "delete_event", but only for the "destroy" signal. This will
still perform the desired function, because an unhandled
"delete_event" will result in a "destroy" signal being given to the
window.

<!-- ***************************************************************** -->
<sect> Miscellaneous Widgets
<!-- ***************************************************************** -->

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1> Labels
<p>
Labels are used a lot in GTK, and are relatively simple. Labels emit
no signals as they do not have an associated X window. If you need to
catch signals, or do clipping, place it inside a <ref id="sec_EventBox"
name="EventBox"> widget or a Button widget.

To create a new label, use:

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_label_new( char *str );
</verb></tscreen>

The sole argument is the string you wish the label to display.

To change the label's text after creation, use the function:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_label_set_text( GtkLabel *label,
                         char     *str );
</verb></tscreen>

The first argument is the label you created previously (cast
using the <tt/GTK_LABEL()/ macro), and the second is the new string.

The space needed for the new string will be automatically adjusted if
needed. You can produce multi-line labels by putting line breaks in
the label string.

To retrieve the current string, use:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_label_get( GtkLabel  *label,
                    char     **str );
</verb></tscreen>

The first argument is the label you've created, and the second,
the return for the string. Do not free the return string, as it is
used internally by GTK.

The label text can be justified using:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_label_set_justify( GtkLabel         *label,
                            GtkJustification  jtype );
</verb></tscreen>

Values for <tt/jtype/ are:
<tscreen><verb>
  GTK_JUSTIFY_LEFT
  GTK_JUSTIFY_RIGHT
  GTK_JUSTIFY_CENTER (the default)
  GTK_JUSTIFY_FILL
</verb></tscreen>

The label widget is also capable of line wrapping the text
automatically. This can be activated using:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_label_set_line_wrap (GtkLabel *label,
                              gboolean  wrap);
</verb></tscreen>

The <tt/wrap/ argument takes a TRUE or FALSE value.

If you want your label underlined, then you can set a pattern on the
label:

<tscreen><verb>
void       gtk_label_set_pattern   (GtkLabel          *label,
                                    const gchar       *pattern);
</verb></tscreen>

The pattern argument indicates how the underlining should look. It
consists of a string of underscore and space characters. An underscore
indicates that the corresponding character in the label should be
underlined. For example, the string <verb/"__     __"/ would underline the
first two characters and eight and ninth characters.

Below is a short example to illustrate these functions. This example
makes use of the Frame widget to better demonstrate the label
styles. You can ignore this for now as the <ref id="sec_Frames"
name="Frame"> widget is explained later on.

<sect1> Arrows
<p>
The Arrow widget draws an arrowhead, facing in a number of possible
directions and having a number of possible styles. It can be very
useful when placed on a button in many applications. Like the Label
widget, it emits no signals.

There are only two functions for manipulating an Arrow widget:

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_arrow_new( GtkArrowType   arrow_type,
                          GtkShadowType  shadow_type );

void gtk_arrow_set( GtkArrow      *arrow,
                    GtkArrowType   arrow_type,
                    GtkShadowType  shadow_type );
</verb></tscreen>

The first creates a new arrow widget with the indicated type and
appearance. The second allows these values to be altered
retrospectively. The <tt/arrow_type/ argument may take one of the
following values:

<tscreen><verb>
  GTK_ARROW_UP
  GTK_ARROW_DOWN
  GTK_ARROW_LEFT
  GTK_ARROW_RIGHT
</verb></tscreen>

These values obviously indicate the direction in which the arrow will
point. The <tt/shadow_type/ argument may take one of these values:

<tscreen><verb>
  GTK_SHADOW_IN
  GTK_SHADOW_OUT (the default)
  GTK_SHADOW_ETCHED_IN
  GTK_SHADOW_ETCHED_OUT
</verb></tscreen>

Here's a brief example to illustrate their use.

<tscreen><verb>
/* example-start arrow arrow.c */

#include <gtk/gtk.h>

/* Create an Arrow widget with the specified parameters
 * and pack it into a button */
GtkWidget *create_arrow_button( GtkArrowType  arrow_type,
				GtkShadowType shadow_type )
{
  GtkWidget *button;
  GtkWidget *arrow;

  button = gtk_button_new();
  arrow = gtk_arrow_new (arrow_type, shadow_type);

  gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (button), arrow);
  
  gtk_widget_show(button);
  gtk_widget_show(arrow);

  return(button);
}

int main( int   argc,
          char *argv[] )
{
  /* GtkWidget is the storage type for widgets */
  GtkWidget *window;
  GtkWidget *button;
  GtkWidget *box;

  /* Initialize the toolkit */
  gtk_init (&amp;argc, &amp;argv);

  /* Create a new window */
  window = gtk_window_new (GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);

  gtk_window_set_title (GTK_WINDOW (window), "Arrow Buttons");

  /* It's a good idea to do this for all windows. */
  gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT (window), "destroy",
		      GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (gtk_main_quit), NULL);

  /* Sets the border width of the window. */
  gtk_container_set_border_width (GTK_CONTAINER (window), 10);

  /* Create a box to hold the arrows/buttons */
  box = gtk_hbox_new (FALSE, 0);
  gtk_container_set_border_width (GTK_CONTAINER (box), 2);
  gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (window), box);

  /* Pack and show all our widgets */
  gtk_widget_show(box);

  button = create_arrow_button(GTK_ARROW_UP, GTK_SHADOW_IN);
  gtk_box_pack_start (GTK_BOX (box), button, FALSE, FALSE, 3);

  button = create_arrow_button(GTK_ARROW_DOWN, GTK_SHADOW_OUT);
  gtk_box_pack_start (GTK_BOX (box), button, FALSE, FALSE, 3);
  
  button = create_arrow_button(GTK_ARROW_LEFT, GTK_SHADOW_ETCHED_IN);
  gtk_box_pack_start (GTK_BOX (box), button, FALSE, FALSE, 3);
  
  button = create_arrow_button(GTK_ARROW_RIGHT, GTK_SHADOW_ETCHED_OUT);
  gtk_box_pack_start (GTK_BOX (box), button, FALSE, FALSE, 3);
  
  gtk_widget_show (window);
  
  /* Rest in gtk_main and wait for the fun to begin! */
  gtk_main ();
  
  return(0);
}
/* example-end */
</verb></tscreen>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>The Tooltips Object
<p>
These are the little text strings that pop up when you leave your
pointer over a button or other widget for a few seconds. They are easy
to use, so I will just explain them without giving an example. If you
want to see some code, take a look at the testgtk.c program
distributed with GTK.

Widgets that do not receive events (widgets that do not have their
own window) will not work with tooltips.

The first call you will use creates a new tooltip. You only need to do
this once for a set of tooltips as the <tt/GtkTooltips/ object this
function returns can be used to create multiple tooltips.

<tscreen><verb>
GtkTooltips *gtk_tooltips_new( void );
</verb></tscreen>

Once you have created a new tooltip, and the widget you wish to use it
on, simply use this call to set it:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_tooltips_set_tip( GtkTooltips *tooltips,
                           GtkWidget   *widget,
                           const gchar *tip_text,
                           const gchar *tip_private );
</verb></tscreen>

The first argument is the tooltip you've already created, followed by
the widget you wish to have this tooltip pop up for, and the text you
wish it to say. The last argument is a text string that can be used as
an identifier when using GtkTipsQuery to implement context sensitive
help. For now, you can set it to NULL.

<!-- TODO: sort out what how to do the context sensitive help -->

Here's a short example:

<tscreen><verb>
GtkTooltips *tooltips;
GtkWidget *button;
.
.
.
tooltips = gtk_tooltips_new ();
button = gtk_button_new_with_label ("button 1");
.
.
.
gtk_tooltips_set_tip (tooltips, button, "This is button 1", NULL);
</verb></tscreen>

There are other calls that can be used with tooltips. I will just list
them with a brief description of what they do.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_tooltips_enable( GtkTooltips *tooltips );
</verb></tscreen>

Enable a disabled set of tooltips.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_tooltips_disable( GtkTooltips *tooltips );
</verb></tscreen>

Disable an enabled set of tooltips.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_tooltips_set_delay( GtkTooltips *tooltips,
                             gint         delay );

</verb></tscreen>

Sets how many milliseconds you have to hold your pointer over the
widget before the tooltip will pop up. The default is 500
milliseconds (half a second).

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_tooltips_set_colors( GtkTooltips *tooltips,
                              GdkColor    *background,
                              GdkColor    *foreground );
</verb></tscreen>

Set the foreground and background color of the tooltips.

And that's all the functions associated with tooltips. More than
you'll ever want to know :-)

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1> Progress Bars <label id="sec_ProgressBar">
<p>
Progress bars are used to show the status of an operation. They are
pretty easy to use, as you will see with the code below. But first
lets start out with the calls to create a new progress bar.

There are two ways to create a progress bar, one simple that takes
no arguments, and one that takes an Adjustment object as an
argument. If the former is used, the progress bar creates its own
adjustment object.

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_progress_bar_new( void );

GtkWidget *gtk_progress_bar_new_with_adjustment( GtkAdjustment *adjustment );
</verb></tscreen>

The second method has the advantage that we can use the adjustment
object to specify our own range parameters for the progress bar.

The adjustment of a progress object can be changed dynamically using:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_progress_set_adjustment( GtkProgress   *progress,
                                  GtkAdjustment *adjustment );
</verb></tscreen>

Now that the progress bar has been created we can use it.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_progress_bar_update( GtkProgressBar *pbar,
                              gfloat          percentage );
</verb></tscreen>

The first argument is the progress bar you wish to operate on, and the
second argument is the amount "completed", meaning the amount the
progress bar has been filled from 0-100%. This is passed to the
function as a real number ranging from 0 to 1.

GTK v1.2 has added new functionality to the progress bar that enables
it to display its value in different ways, and to inform the user of
its current value and its range.

A progress bar may be set to one of a number of orientations using the
function

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_progress_bar_set_orientation( GtkProgressBar *pbar,
                                       GtkProgressBarOrientation orientation );
</verb></tscreen>

The <tt/orientation/ argument may take one of the following
values to indicate the direction in which the progress bar moves:

<tscreen><verb>
  GTK_PROGRESS_LEFT_TO_RIGHT
  GTK_PROGRESS_RIGHT_TO_LEFT
  GTK_PROGRESS_BOTTOM_TO_TOP
  GTK_PROGRESS_TOP_TO_BOTTOM
</verb></tscreen>

When used as a measure of how far a process has progressed, the
ProgressBar can be set to display its value in either a continuous
or discrete mode. In continuous mode, the progress bar is updated for
each value. In discrete mode, the progress bar is updated in a number
of discrete blocks. The number of blocks is also configurable.

The style of a progress bar can be set using the following function.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_progress_bar_set_bar_style( GtkProgressBar      *pbar,
                                     GtkProgressBarStyle  style );
</verb></tscreen>

The <tt/style/ parameter can take one of two values:

<tscreen><verb>
  GTK_PROGRESS_CONTINUOUS
  GTK_PROGRESS_DISCRETE
</verb></tscreen>

The number of discrete blocks can be set by calling

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_progress_bar_set_discrete_blocks( GtkProgressBar *pbar,
                                           guint           blocks );
</verb></tscreen>

As well as indicating the amount of progress that has occured, the
progress bar may be set to just indicate that there is some
activity. This can be useful in situations where progress cannot be
measured against a value range. Activity mode is not effected by the
bar style that is described above, and overrides it. This mode is
either TRUE or FALSE, and is selected by the following function.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_progress_set_activity_mode( GtkProgress *progress,
                                     guint        activity_mode );
</verb></tscreen>

The step size of the activity indicator, and the number of blocks are
set using the following functions.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_progress_bar_set_activity_step( GtkProgressBar *pbar,
                                         guint           step );

void gtk_progress_bar_set_activity_blocks( GtkProgressBar *pbar,
                                           guint           blocks );
</verb></tscreen>

When in continuous mode, the progress bar can also display a
configurable text string within its trough, using the following
function.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_progress_set_format_string( GtkProgress *progress,
                                     gchar       *format);
</verb></tscreen>

The <tt/format/ argument is similiar to one that would be used in a C
<tt/printf/ statement. The following directives may be used within the
format string:

<itemize>
<item> %p - percentage
<item> %v - value
<item> %l - lower range value
<item> %u - upper range value
</itemize>

The displaying of this text string can be toggled using:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_progress_set_show_text( GtkProgress *progress,
                                 gint         show_text );
</verb></tscreen>

The <tt/show_text/ argument is a boolean TRUE/FALSE value. The
appearance of the text can be modified further using:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_progress_set_text_alignment( GtkProgress   *progress,
                                      gfloat         x_align,
                                      gfloat         y_align );
</verb></tscreen>

The <tt/x_align/ and <tt/y_align/ arguments take values between 0.0
and 1.0. Their values indicate the position of the text string within
the trough. Values of 0.0 for both would place the string in the top
left hand corner; values of 0.5 (the default) centres the text, and
values of 1.0 places the text in the lower right hand corner.

The current text setting of a progress object can be retrieved using
the current or a specified adjustment value using the following two
functions. The character string returned by these functions should be
freed by the application (using the g_free() function). These
functions return the formatted string that would be displayed within
the trough.

<tscreen><verb>
gchar *gtk_progress_get_current_text( GtkProgress   *progress );

gchar *gtk_progress_get_text_from_value( GtkProgress *progress,
                                         gfloat       value );
</verb></tscreen>

There is yet another way to change the range and value of a progress
object using the following function:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_progress_configure( GtkProgress  *progress,
                             gfloat        value,
                             gfloat        min,
                             gfloat        max );
</verb></tscreen>

This function provides quite a simple interface to the range and value
of a progress object.

The remaining functions can be used to get and set the current value
of a progess object in various types and formats:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_progress_set_percentage( GtkProgress *progress,
                                  gfloat       percentage );

void gtk_progress_set_value( GtkProgress *progress,
                             gfloat       value );

gfloat gtk_progress_get_value( GtkProgress *progress );

gfloat gtk_progress_get_current_percentage( GtkProgress *progress );

gfloat gtk_progress_get_percentage_from_value( GtkProgress *progress,
                                               gfloat       value );
</verb></tscreen>

These functions are pretty self explanatory. The last function uses
the the adjustment of the specified progess object to compute the
percentage value of the given range value.

Progress Bars are usually used with timeouts or other such functions
(see section on <ref id="sec_timeouts" name="Timeouts, I/O and Idle
Functions">) to give the illusion of multitasking. All will employ the
gtk_progress_bar_update function in the same manner.

Here is an example of the progress bar, updated using timeouts. This
code also shows you how to reset the Progress Bar.

<tscreen><verb>

<sect1> Dialogs
<p>
The Dialog widget is very simple, and is actually just a window with a
few things pre-packed into it for you. The structure for a Dialog is:

<tscreen><verb>
struct GtkDialog
{
      GtkWindow window;
    
      GtkWidget *vbox;
      GtkWidget *action_area;
};
</verb></tscreen>

So you see, it simply creates a window, and then packs a vbox into the
top, which contains a separator and then an hbox called the
"action_area".

The Dialog widget can be used for pop-up messages to the user, and
other similar tasks. It is really basic, and there is only one
function for the dialog box, which is:

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_dialog_new( void );
</verb></tscreen>

So to create a new dialog box, use,

<tscreen><verb>
    GtkWidget *window;
    window = gtk_dialog_new ();
</verb></tscreen>

This will create the dialog box, and it is now up to you to use it.
You could pack a button in the action_area by doing something like this:

<tscreen><verb>
    button = ...
    gtk_box_pack_start (GTK_BOX (GTK_DIALOG (window)->action_area),
                        button, TRUE, TRUE, 0);
    gtk_widget_show (button);
</verb></tscreen>

And you could add to the vbox area by packing, for instance, a label 
in it, try something like this:

<tscreen><verb>
    label = gtk_label_new ("Dialogs are groovy");
    gtk_box_pack_start (GTK_BOX (GTK_DIALOG (window)->vbox),
                        label, TRUE, TRUE, 0);
    gtk_widget_show (label);
</verb></tscreen>

As an example in using the dialog box, you could put two buttons in
the action_area, a Cancel button and an Ok button, and a label in the
vbox area, asking the user a question or giving an error etc. Then
you could attach a different signal to each of the buttons and perform
the operation the user selects.

If the simple functionality provided by the default vertical and
horizontal boxes in the two areas doesn't give you enough control for
your application, then you can simply pack another layout widget into
the boxes provided. For example, you could pack a table into the
vertical box.

<sect1> Pixmaps <label id="sec_Pixmaps">
<p>
Pixmaps are data structures that contain pictures. These pictures can
be used in various places, but most commonly as icons on the X
desktop, or as cursors.

A pixmap which only has 2 colors is called a bitmap, and there are a
few additional routines for handling this common special case.

To understand pixmaps, it would help to understand how X window
system works. Under X, applications do not need to be running on the
same computer that is interacting with the user. Instead, the various
applications, called "clients", all communicate with a program which
displays the graphics and handles the keyboard and mouse. This
program which interacts directly with the user is called a "display
server" or "X server." Since the communication might take place over
a network, it's important to keep some information with the X server.
Pixmaps, for example, are stored in the memory of the X server. This
means that once pixmap values are set, they don't need to keep getting
transmitted over the network; instead a command is sent to "display
pixmap number XYZ here." Even if you aren't using X with GTK
currently, using constructs such as Pixmaps will make your programs
work acceptably under X.

To use pixmaps in GTK, we must first build a GdkPixmap structure using
routines from the GDK layer. Pixmaps can either be created from
in-memory data, or from data read from a file. We'll go through each
of the calls to create a pixmap.

<tscreen><verb>
GdkPixmap *gdk_bitmap_create_from_data( GdkWindow *window,
                                        gchar     *data,
                                        gint       width,
                                        gint       height );
</verb></tscreen>

This routine is used to create a single-plane pixmap (2 colors) from
data in memory. Each bit of the data represents whether that pixel is
off or on. Width and height are in pixels. The GdkWindow pointer is to
the current window, since a pixmap's resources are meaningful only in
the context of the screen where it is to be displayed.

<tscreen><verb>
GdkPixmap *gdk_pixmap_create_from_data( GdkWindow *window,
                                        gchar     *data,
                                        gint       width,
                                        gint       height,
                                        gint       depth,
                                        GdkColor  *fg,
                                        GdkColor  *bg );
</verb></tscreen>

This is used to create a pixmap of the given depth (number of colors) from
the bitmap data specified. <tt/fg/ and <tt/bg/ are the foreground and
background color to use.

<tscreen><verb>
GdkPixmap *gdk_pixmap_create_from_xpm( GdkWindow   *window,
                                       GdkBitmap  **mask,
                                       GdkColor    *transparent_color,
                                       const gchar *filename );
</verb></tscreen>

XPM format is a readable pixmap representation for the X Window
System. It is widely used and many different utilities are available
for creating image files in this format. The file specified by
filename must contain an image in that format and it is loaded into
the pixmap structure. The mask specifies which bits of the pixmap are
opaque. All other bits are colored using the color specified by
transparent_color. An example using this follows below.

<tscreen><verb>
GdkPixmap *gdk_pixmap_create_from_xpm_d( GdkWindow  *window,
                                         GdkBitmap **mask,
                                         GdkColor   *transparent_color,
                                         gchar     **data );
</verb></tscreen>

Small images can be incorporated into a program as data in the XPM
format. A pixmap is created using this data, instead of reading it
from a file. An example of such data is

<tscreen><verb>
/* XPM */
static const char * xpm_data[] = {
"16 16 3 1",
"       c None",
".      c #000000000000",
"X      c #FFFFFFFFFFFF",
"                ",
"   ......       ",
"   .XXX.X.      ",
"   .XXX.XX.     ",
"   .XXX.XXX.    ",
"   .XXX.....    ",
"   .XXXXXXX.    ",
"   .XXXXXXX.    ",
"   .XXXXXXX.    ",
"   .XXXXXXX.    ",
"   .XXXXXXX.    ",
"   .XXXXXXX.    ",
"   .XXXXXXX.    ",
"   .........    ",
"                ",
"                "};
</verb></tscreen>

When we're done using a pixmap and not likely to reuse it again soon,
it is a good idea to release the resource using
gdk_pixmap_unref(). Pixmaps should be considered a precious resource,
because they take up memory in the end-user's X server process. Even
though the X client you write may run on a powerful "server" computer,
the user may be running the X server on a small personal computer.

Once we've created a pixmap, we can display it as a GTK widget. We
must create a GTK pixmap widget to contain the GDK pixmap. This is
done using

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_pixmap_new( GdkPixmap *pixmap,
                           GdkBitmap *mask );
</verb></tscreen>

The other pixmap widget calls are

<tscreen><verb>
guint gtk_pixmap_get_type( void );

void  gtk_pixmap_set( GtkPixmap  *pixmap,
                      GdkPixmap  *val,
                      GdkBitmap  *mask );

void  gtk_pixmap_get( GtkPixmap  *pixmap,
                      GdkPixmap **val,
                      GdkBitmap **mask);
</verb></tscreen>

gtk_pixmap_set is used to change the pixmap that the widget is currently
managing. Val is the pixmap created using GDK.

The following is an example of using a pixmap in a button.

<tscreen><verb>
/* example-start pixmap pixmap.c */

    gtk_main_quit();
    return(FALSE);
}


/* is invoked when the button is clicked.  It just prints a message.

void button_clicked( GtkWidget *widget,
                     gpointer   data ) {
    g_print( "button clicked\n" );
}

int main( int   argc,
          char *argv[] )
{
    /* GtkWidget is the storage type for widgets */
    GtkWidget *window, *pixmapwid, *button;
    GdkPixmap *pixmap;
    GdkBitmap *mask;
    GtkStyle *style;
    
    /* create the main window, and attach delete_event signal to terminating

    gtk_init( &amp;argc, &amp;argv );

    gtk_container_set_border_width( GTK_CONTAINER (window), 10 );
    gtk_widget_show( window );

    /* now for the pixmap from gdk */
    style = gtk_widget_get_style( window );
    pixmap = gdk_pixmap_create_from_xpm_d( window->window,  &amp;mask,
                                           &amp;style->bg[GTK_STATE_NORMAL],
                                           (gchar **)xpm_data );

    /* a pixmap widget to contain the pixmap */
    pixmapwid = gtk_pixmap_new( pixmap, mask );
    gtk_widget_show( pixmapwid );

    /* a button to contain the pixmap widget */
    button = gtk_button_new();
    gtk_container_add( GTK_CONTAINER(button), pixmapwid );
    gtk_container_add( GTK_CONTAINER(window), button );
    gtk_widget_show( button );

    gtk_signal_connect( GTK_OBJECT(button), "clicked",
                        GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC(button_clicked), NULL );

    /* show the window */
    gtk_main ();
          
    return 0;
}
/* example-end */
</verb></tscreen>

To load a file from an XPM data file called icon0.xpm in the current
directory, we would have created the pixmap thus

<tscreen><verb>
    /* load a pixmap from a file */
    pixmap = gdk_pixmap_create_from_xpm( window->window, &amp;mask,
                                         &amp;style->bg[GTK_STATE_NORMAL],
                                         "./icon0.xpm" );
    pixmapwid = gtk_pixmap_new( pixmap, mask );
    gtk_widget_show( pixmapwid );
    gtk_container_add( GTK_CONTAINER(window), pixmapwid );
</verb></tscreen>

A disadvantage of using pixmaps is that the displayed object is always
rectangular, regardless of the image. We would like to create desktops
and applications with icons that have more natural shapes. For
example, for a game interface, we would like to have round buttons to
push. The way to do this is using shaped windows.

A shaped window is simply a pixmap where the background pixels are
transparent. This way, when the background image is multi-colored, we
don't overwrite it with a rectangular, non-matching border around our
icon. The following example displays a full wheelbarrow image on the
desktop.

<tscreen><verb>
/* example-start wheelbarrow wheelbarrow.c */

#include <gtk/gtk.h>

To make the wheelbarrow image sensitive, we could attach the button
press event signal to make it do something. The following few lines
would make the picture sensitive to a mouse button being pressed which
makes the application terminate.

                          GDK_BUTTON_PRESS_MASK );

   gtk_signal_connect( GTK_OBJECT(window), "button_press_event",

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Rulers
<p>
Ruler widgets are used to indicate the location of the mouse pointer
in a given window. A window can have a vertical ruler spanning across
the width and a horizontal ruler spanning down the height. A small
triangular indicator on the ruler shows the exact location of the
pointer relative to the ruler.

A ruler must first be created. Horizontal and vertical rulers are
created using

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_hruler_new( void );    /* horizontal ruler */

GtkWidget *gtk_vruler_new( void );    /* vertical ruler   */
</verb></tscreen>

Once a ruler is created, we can define the unit of measurement. Units
of measure for rulers can be<tt/GTK_PIXELS/, <tt/GTK_INCHES/ or
<tt/GTK_CENTIMETERS/. This is set using

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_ruler_set_metric( GtkRuler      *ruler,
                           GtkMetricType  metric );
</verb></tscreen>

The default measure is <tt/GTK_PIXELS/.

<tscreen><verb>
    gtk_ruler_set_metric( GTK_RULER(ruler), GTK_PIXELS );
</verb></tscreen>

Other important characteristics of a ruler are how to mark the units
of scale and where the position indicator is initially placed. These
are set for a ruler using

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_ruler_set_range( GtkRuler *ruler,
                          gfloat    lower,
                          gfloat    upper,
                          gfloat    position,
                          gfloat    max_size );
</verb></tscreen>

The lower and upper arguments define the extent of the ruler, and
max_size is the largest possible number that will be displayed.
Position defines the initial position of the pointer indicator within
the ruler.

A vertical ruler can span an 800 pixel wide window thus

<tscreen><verb>
    gtk_ruler_set_range( GTK_RULER(vruler), 0, 800, 0, 800);
</verb></tscreen>

The markings displayed on the ruler will be from 0 to 800, with a
number for every 100 pixels. If instead we wanted the ruler to range
from 7 to 16, we would code

<tscreen><verb>
    gtk_ruler_set_range( GTK_RULER(vruler), 7, 16, 0, 20);
</verb></tscreen>

The indicator on the ruler is a small triangular mark that indicates
the position of the pointer relative to the ruler. If the ruler is
used to follow the mouse pointer, the motion_notify_event signal
should be connected to the motion_notify_event method of the ruler.
To follow all mouse movements within a window area, we would use

<tscreen><verb>
#define EVENT_METHOD(i, x) GTK_WIDGET_CLASS(GTK_OBJECT(i)->klass)->x

    gtk_signal_connect_object( GTK_OBJECT(area), "motion_notify_event",
           (GtkSignalFunc)EVENT_METHOD(ruler, motion_notify_event),
           GTK_OBJECT(ruler) );
</verb></tscreen>

The following example creates a drawing area with a horizontal ruler
above it and a vertical ruler to the left of it. The size of the
drawing area is 600 pixels wide by 400 pixels high. The horizontal
ruler spans from 7 to 13 with a mark every 100 pixels, while the
vertical ruler spans from 0 to 400 with a mark every 100 pixels.
Placement of the drawing area and the rulers is done using a table.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Statusbars
<p>
Statusbars are simple widgets used to display a text message. They
keep a stack of the messages pushed onto them, so that popping the
current message will re-display the previous text message.

In order to allow different parts of an application to use the same
statusbar to display messages, the statusbar widget issues Context
Identifiers which are used to identify different "users". The message
on top of the stack is the one displayed, no matter what context it is
in. Messages are stacked in last-in-first-out order, not context
identifier order.

A statusbar is created with a call to:

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_statusbar_new( void );
</verb></tscreen>

A new Context Identifier is requested using a call to the following 
function with a short textual description of the context:

<tscreen><verb>
guint gtk_statusbar_get_context_id( GtkStatusbar *statusbar,
                                    const gchar  *context_description );
</verb></tscreen>

There are three functions that can operate on statusbars:

<tscreen><verb>
guint gtk_statusbar_push( GtkStatusbar *statusbar,
                          guint         context_id,
                          gchar        *text );

void gtk_statusbar_pop( GtkStatusbar *statusbar)
                        guint         context_id );

void gtk_statusbar_remove( GtkStatusbar *statusbar,
                           guint         context_id,
                           guint         message_id ); 
</verb></tscreen>

The first, gtk_statusbar_push, is used to add a new message to the
statusbar.  It returns a Message Identifier, which can be passed later
to the function gtk_statusbar_remove to remove the message with the
given Message and Context Identifiers from the statusbar's stack.

The function gtk_statusbar_pop removes the message highest in the
stack with the given Context Identifier.

The following example creates a statusbar and two buttons, one for
pushing items onto the statusbar, and one for popping the last item
back off.

<tscreen><verb>
/* example-start statusbar statusbar.c */

#include <gtk/gtk.h>

GtkWidget *status_bar;

void push_item( GtkWidget *widget,

{
  static int count = 1;
  char buff[20];

  g_snprintf(buff, 20, "Item %d", count++);
  gtk_statusbar_push( GTK_STATUSBAR(status_bar), GPOINTER_TO_INT(data), buff);

  return;
}

void pop_item( GtkWidget *widget,
               gpointer   data )
{
  gtk_statusbar_pop( GTK_STATUSBAR(status_bar), GPOINTER_TO_INT(data) );
  return;
}

int main( int   argc,
          char *argv[] )

    gtk_signal_connect(GTK_OBJECT (window), "delete_event",
                       (GtkSignalFunc) gtk_exit, NULL);
 
    vbox = gtk_vbox_new(FALSE, 1);
    gtk_container_add(GTK_CONTAINER(window), vbox);

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Text Entries
<p>
The Entry widget allows text to be typed and displayed in a single line
text box. The text may be set with function calls that allow new text
to replace, prepend or append the current contents of the Entry widget.

There are two functions for creating Entry widgets:

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_entry_new( void );

GtkWidget *gtk_entry_new_with_max_length( guint16 max );
</verb></tscreen>

The first just creates a new Entry widget, whilst the second creates a
new Entry and sets a limit on the length of the text within the Entry.

There are several functions for altering the text which is currently
within the Entry widget.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_entry_set_text( GtkEntry    *entry,
                         const gchar *text );

void gtk_entry_append_text( GtkEntry    *entry,
                            const gchar *text );

void gtk_entry_prepend_text( GtkEntry    *entry,
                             const gchar *text );
</verb></tscreen>

The function gtk_entry_set_text sets the contents of the Entry widget,
replacing the current contents. The functions gtk_entry_append_text
and gtk_entry_prepend_text allow the current contents to be appended
and prepended to.

The next function allows the current insertion point to be set.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_entry_set_position( GtkEntry *entry,
                             gint      position );
</verb></tscreen>

The contents of the Entry can be retrieved by using a call to the
following function. This is useful in the callback functions described below.

<tscreen><verb>
gchar *gtk_entry_get_text( GtkEntry *entry );
</verb></tscreen>

The value returned by this function is used internally, and must not
be freed using either free() or g_free()

If we don't want the contents of the Entry to be changed by someone typing
into it, we can change its editable state.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_entry_set_editable( GtkEntry *entry,
                             gboolean  editable );
</verb></tscreen>

The function above allows us to toggle the editable state of the
Entry widget by passing in a TRUE or FALSE value for the <tt/editable/
argument.

If we are using the Entry where we don't want the text entered to be
visible, for example when a password is being entered, we can use the
following function, which also takes a boolean flag.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_entry_set_visibility( GtkEntry *entry,
                               gboolean  visible );
</verb></tscreen>

A region of the text may be set as selected by using the following
function. This would most often be used after setting some default
text in an Entry, making it easy for the user to remove it.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_entry_select_region( GtkEntry *entry,
                              gint      start,
                              gint      end );
</verb></tscreen>

If we want to catch when the user has entered text, we can connect to
the <tt/activate/ or <tt/changed/ signal. Activate is raised when the
user hits the enter key within the Entry widget. Changed is raised
when the text changes at all, e.g., for every character entered or
removed.

The following code is an example of using an Entry widget.

<tscreen><verb>
/* example-start entry entry.c */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <gtk/gtk.h>

void enter_callback( GtkWidget *widget,
                     GtkWidget *entry )
{
  gchar *entry_text;
  entry_text = gtk_entry_get_text(GTK_ENTRY(entry));
  printf("Entry contents: %s\n", entry_text);
}

void entry_toggle_editable( GtkWidget *checkbutton,
                            GtkWidget *entry )
{
  gtk_entry_set_editable(GTK_ENTRY(entry),
			 GTK_TOGGLE_BUTTON(checkbutton)->active);
}

void entry_toggle_visibility( GtkWidget *checkbutton,
                              GtkWidget *entry )
{
  gtk_entry_set_visibility(GTK_ENTRY(entry),
			 GTK_TOGGLE_BUTTON(checkbutton)->active);
}

int main( int   argc,
          char *argv[] )
{

    GtkWidget *window;
    GtkWidget *vbox, *hbox;
    GtkWidget *entry;
    GtkWidget *button;
    GtkWidget *check;

    gtk_init (&amp;argc, &amp;argv);

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Spin Buttons
<p>
The Spin Button widget is generally used to allow the user to select a
value from a range of numeric values. It consists of a text
entry box with up and down arrow buttons attached to the
side. Selecting one of the buttons causes the value to "spin" up and
down the range of possible values. The entry box may also be edited
directly to enter a specific value.

The Spin Button allows the value to have zero or a number of decimal
places and to be incremented/decremented in configurable steps. The
action of holding down one of the buttons optionally results in an
acceleration of change in the value according to how long it is
depressed.

The Spin Button uses an <ref id="sec_Adjustment" name="Adjustment">
object to hold information about the range of values that the spin
button can take. This makes for a powerful Spin Button widget.

Recall that an adjustment widget is created with the following
function, which illustrates the information that it holds:

<tscreen><verb>
GtkObject *gtk_adjustment_new( gfloat value,
                               gfloat lower,
                               gfloat upper,
                               gfloat step_increment,
                               gfloat page_increment,
                               gfloat page_size );
</verb></tscreen>

These attributes of an Adjustment are used by the Spin Button in the
following way:

<itemize>
<item> <tt/value/: initial value for the Spin Button
<item> <tt/lower/: lower range value
<item> <tt/upper/: upper range value
<item> <tt/step_increment/: value to increment/decrement when pressing
mouse button 1 on a button
<item> <tt/page_increment/: value to increment/decrement when pressing
mouse button 2 on a button
<item> <tt/page_size/: unused
</itemize>

Additionally, mouse button 3 can be used to jump directly to the
<tt/upper/ or <tt/lower/ values when used to select one of the
buttons. Lets look at how to create a Spin Button:

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_spin_button_new( GtkAdjustment *adjustment,
                                gfloat         climb_rate,
                                guint          digits );
</verb></tscreen>

The <tt/climb_rate/ argument take a value between 0.0 and 1.0 and
indicates the amount of acceleration that the Spin Button has. The
<tt/digits/ argument specifies the number of decimal places to which
the value will be displayed.

A Spin Button can be reconfigured after creation using the following
function:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_spin_button_configure( GtkSpinButton *spin_button,
                                GtkAdjustment *adjustment,
                                gfloat         climb_rate,
                                guint          digits );
</verb></tscreen>

The <tt/spin_button/ argument specifies the Spin Button widget that is
to be reconfigured. The other arguments are as specified above.

The adjustment can be set and retrieved independantly using the
following two functions:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_spin_button_set_adjustment( GtkSpinButton  *spin_button,
                                     GtkAdjustment  *adjustment );

GtkAdjustment *gtk_spin_button_get_adjustment( GtkSpinButton *spin_button );
</verb></tscreen>

The number of decimal places can also be altered using:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_spin_button_set_digits( GtkSpinButton *spin_button,
                                 guint          digits) ;
</verb></tscreen>

The value that a Spin Button is currently displaying can be changed
using the following function:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_spin_button_set_value( GtkSpinButton *spin_button,
                                gfloat         value );
</verb></tscreen>

The current value of a Spin Button can be retrieved as either a
floating point or integer value with the following functions:

<tscreen><verb>
gfloat gtk_spin_button_get_value_as_float( GtkSpinButton *spin_button );

gint gtk_spin_button_get_value_as_int( GtkSpinButton *spin_button );
</verb></tscreen>

If you want to alter the value of a Spin Value relative to its current
value, then the following function can be used:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_spin_button_spin( GtkSpinButton *spin_button,
                           GtkSpinType    direction,
                           gfloat         increment );
</verb></tscreen>

The <tt/direction/ parameter can take one of the following values:

<tscreen><verb>
  GTK_SPIN_STEP_FORWARD
  GTK_SPIN_STEP_BACKWARD
  GTK_SPIN_PAGE_FORWARD
  GTK_SPIN_PAGE_BACKWARD
  GTK_SPIN_HOME
  GTK_SPIN_END
  GTK_SPIN_USER_DEFINED
</verb></tscreen>

This function packs in quite a bit of functionality, which I will
attempt to clearly explain. Many of these settings use values from the
Adjustment object that is associated with a Spin Button.

<tt/GTK_SPIN_STEP_FORWARD/ and <tt/GTK_SPIN_STEP_BACKWARD/ change the
value of the Spin Button by the amount specified by <tt/increment/,
unless <tt/increment/ is equal to 0, in which case the value is
changed by the value of <tt/step_increment/ in theAdjustment.

<tt/GTK_SPIN_PAGE_FORWARD/ and <tt/GTK_SPIN_PAGE_BACKWARD/ simply
alter the value of the Spin Button by <tt/increment/.

<tt/GTK_SPIN_HOME/ sets the value of the Spin Button to the bottom of
the Adjustments range.

<tt/GTK_SPIN_END/ sets the value of the Spin Button to the top of the
Adjustments range.

<tt/GTK_SPIN_USER_DEFINED/ simply alters the value of the Spin Button
by the specified amount.

We move away from functions for setting and retreving the range attributes
of the Spin Button now, and move onto functions that effect the
appearance and behaviour of the Spin Button widget itself.

The first of these functions is used to constrain the text box of the
Spin Button such that it may only contain a numeric value. This
prevents a user from typing anything other than numeric values into
the text box of a Spin Button:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_spin_button_set_numeric( GtkSpinButton *spin_button,
                                  gboolean       numeric );
</verb></tscreen>

You can set whether a Spin Button will wrap around between the upper
and lower range values with the following function:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_spin_button_set_wrap( GtkSpinButton *spin_button,
                               gboolean       wrap );
</verb></tscreen>

You can set a Spin Button to round the value to the nearest
<tt/step_increment/, which is set within the Adjustment object used
with the Spin Button. This is accomplished with the following
function:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_spin_button_set_snap_to_ticks( GtkSpinButton  *spin_button,
                                        gboolean        snap_to_ticks );
</verb></tscreen>

The update policy of a Spin Button can be changed with the following
function:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_spin_button_set_update_policy( GtkSpinButton  *spin_button,
                                    GtkSpinButtonUpdatePolicy policy );
</verb></tscreen>

<!-- TODO: find out what this does - TRG -->

The possible values of <tt/policy/ are either <tt/GTK_UPDATE_ALWAYS/ or
<tt/GTK_UPDATE_IF_VALID/.

These policies affect the behavior of a Spin Button when parsing
inserted text and syncing its value with the values of the
Adjustment.

In the case of <tt/GTK_UPDATE_IF_VALID/ the Spin Button only value
gets changed if the text input is a numeric value that is within the
range specified by the Adjustment. Otherwise the text is reset to the
current value.

In case of <tt/GTK_UPDATE_ALWAYS/ we ignore errors while converting
text into a numeric value.

The appearance of the buttons used in a Spin Button can be changed
using the following function:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_spin_button_set_shadow_type( GtkSpinButton *spin_button,
                                      GtkShadowType  shadow_type );
</verb></tscreen>

As usual, the <tt/shadow_type/ can be one of:

<tscreen><verb>
  GTK_SHADOW_IN
  GTK_SHADOW_OUT
  GTK_SHADOW_ETCHED_IN
  GTK_SHADOW_ETCHED_OUT
</verb></tscreen>

Finally, you can explicitly request that a Spin Button update itself:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_spin_button_update( GtkSpinButton  *spin_button );
</verb></tscreen>

It's example time again.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Combo Box
<p>
The combo box is another fairly simple widget that is really just a
collection of other widgets. From the user's point of view, the widget
consists of a text entry box and a pull down menu from which the user
can select one of a set of predefined entries. Alternatively, the user
can type a different option directly into the text box.

The following extract from the structure that defines a Combo Box
identifies several of the components:

<tscreen><verb>
struct _GtkCombo { 
        GtkHBox hbox; 
        GtkWidget *entry; 
        GtkWidget *button;
        GtkWidget *popup; 
        GtkWidget *popwin; 
        GtkWidget *list;
	...  };
</verb></tscreen>

As you can see, the Combo Box has two principal parts that you really
care about: an entry and a list.

First off, to create a combo box, use:

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_combo_new( void );
</verb></tscreen>

Now, if you want to set the string in the entry section of the combo
box, this is done by manipulating the <tt/entry/ widget directly:

<tscreen><verb>
    gtk_entry_set_text(GTK_ENTRY(GTK_COMBO(combo)->entry), "My String.");
</verb></tscreen>

To set the values in the popdown list, one uses the function:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_combo_set_popdown_strings( GtkCombo *combo,
                                    GList    *strings );
</verb></tscreen>

Before you can do this, you have to assemble a GList of the strings
that you want. GList is a linked list implementation that is part of
<ref id="sec_glib" name="GLib">, a library supporing GTK. For the
moment, the quick and dirty explanation is that you need to set up a
GList pointer, set it equal to NULL, then append strings to it with

<tscreen><verb>
GList *g_list_append( GList *glist, 
                      gpointer data );
</verb></tscreen>

It is important that you set the initial GList pointer to NULL. The
value returned from the g_list_append function must be used as the new
pointer to the GList.

Here's a typical code segment for creating a set of options:

<tscreen><verb>
    GList *glist=NULL;

    glist = g_list_append(glist, "String 1");
    glist = g_list_append(glist, "String 2");
    glist = g_list_append(glist, "String 3"); 
    glist = g_list_append(glist, "String 4");

    gtk_combo_set_popdown_strings( GTK_COMBO(combo), glist) ;
</verb></tscreen>

The combo widget makes a copy of the strings passed to it in the glist
structure. As a result, you need to make sure you free the memory used
by the list if that is appropriate for your application.

At this point you have a working combo box that has been set up.
There are a few aspects of its behavior that you can change. These
are accomplished with the functions: 

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_combo_set_use_arrows( GtkCombo *combo,
                               gint      val );

void gtk_combo_set_use_arrows_always( GtkCombo *combo,
                                      gint      val );

void gtk_combo_set_case_sensitive( GtkCombo *combo,
                                   gint      val );
</verb></tscreen>

<tt/gtk_combo_set_use_arrows()/ lets the user change the value in the
entry using the up/down arrow keys. This doesn't bring up the list, but
rather replaces the current text in the entry with the next list entry
(up or down, as your key choice indicates). It does this by searching
in the list for the item corresponding to the current value in the
entry and selecting the previous/next item accordingly. Usually in an
entry the arrow keys are used to change focus (you can do that anyway
using TAB). Note that when the current item is the last of the list
and you press arrow-down it changes the focus (the same applies with
the first item and arrow-up).

If the current value in the entry is not in the list, then the
function of <tt/gtk_combo_set_use_arrows()/ is disabled.

<tt/gtk_combo_set_use_arrows_always()/ similarly allows the use the
the up/down arrow keys to cycle through the choices in the dropdown
list, except that it wraps around the values in the list, completely
disabling the use of the up and down arrow keys for changing focus.

<tt/gtk_combo_set_case_sensitive()/ toggles whether or not GTK
searches for entries in a case sensitive manner. This is used when the
Combo widget is asked to find a value from the list using the current
entry in the text box. This completion can be performed in either a
case sensitive or insensitive manner, depending upon the use of this
function. The Combo widget can also simply complete the current entry
if the user presses the key combination MOD-1 and "Tab". MOD-1 is
often mapped to the "Alt" key, by the <tt/xmodmap/ utility. Note,
however that some window managers also use this key combination, which
will override its use within GTK.

Now that we have a combo box, tailored to look and act how we want it,
all that remains is being able to get data from the combo box. This is
relatively straightforward. The majority of the time, all you are
going to care about getting data from is the entry. The entry is
accessed simply by <tt>GTK_ENTRY(GTK_COMBO(combo)->entry)</tt>. The
two principal things that you are going to want to do with it are
attach to the activate signal, which indicates that the user has
pressed the Return or Enter key, and read the text. The first is
accomplished using something like:

<tscreen><verb>
    gtk_signal_connect(GTK_OBJECT(GTK_COMB(combo)->entry), "activate",
                       GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (my_callback_function), my_data);
</verb></tscreen>

Getting the text at any arbitrary time is accomplished by simply using
the entry function:

<tscreen><verb>
gchar *gtk_entry_get_text(GtkEntry *entry);
</verb></tscreen>

Such as:

<tscreen><verb>
    char *string;

    string = gtk_entry_get_text(GTK_ENTRY(GTK_COMBO(combo)->entry));
</verb></tscreen>

That's about all there is to it. There is a function

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_combo_disable_activate(GtkCombo *combo);
</verb></tscreen>

that will disable the activate signal on the entry widget in the combo
box. Personally, I can't think of why you'd want to use it, but it
does exist.

<!-- There is also a function to set the string on a particular item, void
gtk_combo_set_item_string(GtkCombo *combo, GtkItem *item, const gchar
*item_value), but this requires that you have a pointer to the
appropriate Item. Frankly, I have no idea how to do that.
-->

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1> Calendar
<p>
The Calendar widget is an effective way to display and retrieve
monthly date related information. It is a very simple widget to create
and work with.

Creating a GtkCalendar widget is a simple as: 

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_calendar_new();
</verb></tscreen>

There might be times where you need to change a lot of information
within this widget and the following functions allow you to make
multiple change to a Calendar widget without the user seeing multiple
on-screen updates.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_calendar_freeze( GtkCalendar *Calendar );

void gtk_calendar_thaw  ( GtkCalendar *Calendar );
</verb></tscreen>

They work just like the freeze/thaw functions of every other
widget.

The Calendar widget has a few options that allow you to change the way
the widget both looks and operates by using the function

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_calendar_display_options( GtkCalendar               *calendar,
                                   GtkCalendarDisplayOptions  flags );
</verb></tscreen>

The <tt/flags/ argument can be formed by combining either of the
following five options using the logical bitwise OR (|) operation:
<itemize>
<item> GTK_CALENDAR_SHOW_HEADING - this option specifies that
the month and year should be shown when drawing the calendar.
<item> GTK_CALENDAR_SHOW_DAY_NAMES - this option specifies that the
three letter descriptions should be displayed for each day (eg
MON,TUE...).

<item> GTK_CALENDAR_NO_MONTH_CHANGE - this option states that the user
should not and can not change the currently displayed month. This can
be good if you only need to display a particular month such as if you
are displaying 12 calendar widgets for every month in a particular
year.

<item> GTK_CALENDAR_SHOW_WEEK_NUMBERS - this option specifies that the
number for each week should be displayed down the left side of the
calendar. (eg. Jan 1 = Week 1,Dec 31 = Week 52).

<item> GTK_CALENDAR_WEEK_START_MONDAY - this option states that the
calander week will start on Monday instead of Sunday which is the
default. This only affects the order in which days are displayed from
left to right.
</itemize>

The following functions are used to set the the currently displayed
date:
<tscreen><verb>
gint gtk_calendar_select_month( GtkCalendar *calendar, 
                                guint        month,
                                guint        year );

void gtk_calendar_select_day( GtkCalendar *calendar,
                              guint        day );
</verb></tscreen>

The return value from <tt/gtk_calendar_select_month()/ is a boolean
value indicating whether the selection was successful.

With <tt/gtk_calendar_select_day()/ the specified day number is
selected within the current month, if that is possible. A
<tt/day/ value of 0 will deselect any current selection.

In addition to having a day selected, any number of days in the month
may be "marked". A marked day is highlighted within the calendar
display. The following functions are provided to manipulate marked
days:

<tscreen><verb>
gint gtk_calendar_mark_day( GtkCalendar *calendar,
                            guint        day);

gint gtk_calendar_unmark_day( GtkCalendar *calendar,
                              guint        day);

void gtk_calendar_clear_marks( GtkCalendar *calendar);
</verb></tscreen>

The currently marked days are stored within an array within the
GtkCalendar structure. This array is 31 elements long so to test
whether a particular day is currently marked, you need to access the
corresponding element of the array (don't forget in C that array
elements are numbered 0 to n-1). For example:

<tscreen><verb>
    GtkCalendar *calendar;
    calendar = gtk_calendar_new();

    ...

    /* Is day 7 marked? */
    if (calendar->marked_date[7-1])
       /* day is marked */
</verb></tscreen>

Note that marks are persistent across month and year changes.

The final Calendar widget function is used to retrieve the currently
selected date, month and/or year.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_calendar_get_date( GtkCalendar *calendar, 
                            guint       *year,
                            guint       *month,
                            guint       *day );
</verb></tscreen>

This function requires you to pass the addresses of <tt/guint/
variables, into which the result will be placed. Passing <tt/NULL/ as
a value will result in the corresponding value not being returned.

The Calendar widget can generate a number of signals indicating date
selection and change. The names of these signals are self explanatory,
and are:

<itemize>
<item> <tt/month_changed/
<item> <tt/day_selected/
<item> <tt/day_selected_double_click/
<item> <tt/prev_month/
<item> <tt/next_month/
<item> <tt/prev_year/
<item> <tt/next_year/
</itemize>

That just leaves us with the need to put all of this together into
example code.

<sect1> Color Selection
<p>
The color selection widget is, not surprisingly, a widget for
interactive selection of colors. This composite widget lets the user
select a color by manipulating RGB (Red, Green, Blue) and HSV (Hue,
Saturation, Value) triples.  This is done either by adjusting single
values with sliders or entries, or by picking the desired color from a
hue-saturation wheel/value bar.  Optionally, the opacity of the color
can also be set.

The color selection widget currently emits only one signal,
"color_changed", which is emitted whenever the current color in the
widget changes, either when the user changes it or if it's set
explicitly through gtk_color_selection_set_color().

Lets have a look at what the color selection widget has to offer
us. The widget comes in two flavours: gtk_color_selection and
gtk_color_selection_dialog.

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_color_selection_new( void );
</verb></tscreen>
	
You'll probably not be using this constructor directly. It creates an
orphan ColorSelection widget which you'll have to parent
yourself. The ColorSelection widget inherits from the VBox
widget.

<tscreen><verb> 
GtkWidget *gtk_color_selection_dialog_new( const gchar *title );
</verb></tscreen>

This is the most common color selection constructor. It creates a
ColorSelectionDialog. It consists of a Frame containing a
ColorSelection widget, an HSeparator and an HBox with three buttons,
"Ok", "Cancel" and "Help". You can reach these buttons by accessing
the "ok_button", "cancel_button" and "help_button" widgets in the
ColorSelectionDialog structure,
(i.e., <tt>GTK_COLOR_SELECTION_DIALOG(colorseldialog)->ok_button</tt>)).

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_color_selection_set_update_policy( GtkColorSelection *colorsel, 
                                            GtkUpdateType      policy );
</verb></tscreen>

This function sets the update policy. The default policy is
<tt/GTK_UPDATE_CONTINUOUS/ which means that the current color is
updated continuously when the user drags the sliders or presses the
mouse and drags in the hue-saturation wheel or value bar. If you
experience performance problems, you may want to set the policy to
<tt/GTK_UPDATE_DISCONTINUOUS/ or <tt/GTK_UPDATE_DELAYED/.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_color_selection_set_opacity( GtkColorSelection *colorsel,
                                      gint               use_opacity );
</verb></tscreen>

The color selection widget supports adjusting the opacity of a color
(also known as the alpha channel). This is disabled by
default. Calling this function with use_opacity set to TRUE enables
opacity. Likewise, use_opacity set to FALSE will disable opacity.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_color_selection_set_color( GtkColorSelection *colorsel,
                                    gdouble           *color );
</verb></tscreen>

You can set the current color explicitly by calling this function with
a pointer to an array of colors (gdouble). The length of the array
depends on whether opacity is enabled or not. Position 0 contains the
red component, 1 is green, 2 is blue and opacity is at position 3
(only if opacity is enabled, see
gtk_color_selection_set_opacity()). All values are between 0.0 and
1.0.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_color_selection_get_color( GtkColorSelection *colorsel,
                                    gdouble           *color );
</verb></tscreen>

When you need to query the current color, typically when you've
received a "color_changed" signal, you use this function. Color is a
pointer to the array of colors to fill in. See the
gtk_color_selection_set_color() function for the description of this
array.

<!-- Need to do a whole section on DnD - TRG
Drag and drop
-------------

The color sample areas (right under the hue-saturation wheel) supports
drag and drop. The type of drag and drop is "application/x-color". The
message data consists of an array of 4 (or 5 if opacity is enabled)
gdouble values, where the value at position 0 is 0.0 (opacity on) or
1.0 (opacity off) followed by the red, green and blue values at
positions 1,2 and 3 respectively.  If opacity is enabled, the opacity
is passed in the value at position 4.
-->

Here's a simple example demonstrating the use of the
ColorSelectionDialog. The program displays a window containing a
drawing area. Clicking on it opens a color selection dialog, and
changing the color in the color selection dialog changes the
background color.

<tscreen><verb>
/* example-start colorsel colorsel.c */

#include <glib.h>
#include <gdk/gdk.h>
#include <gtk/gtk.h>

GtkWidget *colorseldlg = NULL;
GtkWidget *drawingarea = NULL;

/* Color changed handler */

void color_changed_cb( GtkWidget         *widget,
                       GtkColorSelection *colorsel )

  if (event->type == GDK_BUTTON_PRESS &amp;&amp; colorseldlg == NULL)
    {
      /* Yes, we have an event and there's no colorseldlg yet! */

      handled = TRUE;

      /* Create color selection dialog */

      colorseldlg = gtk_color_selection_dialog_new("Select background color");

      /* Get the ColorSelection widget */

      colorsel = GTK_COLOR_SELECTION_DIALOG(colorseldlg)->colorsel;

      /* Connect to the "color_changed" signal, set the client-data
       * to the colorsel widget */

      gtk_signal_connect(GTK_OBJECT(colorsel), "color_changed",
        (GtkSignalFunc)color_changed_cb, (gpointer)colorsel);

      /* Show the dialog */

      gtk_widget_show(colorseldlg);
    }

  return handled;
}

/* Close down and exit handler */

gint destroy_window( GtkWidget *widget,
                     GdkEvent  *event,
                     gpointer   client_data )
{
  gtk_main_quit ();
  return(TRUE);
}

/* Main */

gint main( gint   argc,
           gchar *argv[] )
{
  GtkWidget *window;

  /* Initialize the toolkit, remove gtk-related commandline stuff */

  gtk_init (&amp;argc,&amp;argv);

  /* Create toplevel window, set title and policies */

  window = gtk_window_new (GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
  gtk_window_set_title (GTK_WINDOW(window), "Color selection test");
  gtk_window_set_policy (GTK_WINDOW(window), TRUE, TRUE, TRUE);

  /* Attach to the "delete" and "destroy" events so we can exit */

  gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT(window), "delete_event",
    (GtkSignalFunc)destroy_window, (gpointer)window);
  
  /* Create drawingarea, set size and catch button events */

  drawingarea = gtk_drawing_area_new ();

  gtk_drawing_area_size (GTK_DRAWING_AREA(drawingarea), 200, 200);

  gtk_widget_set_events (drawingarea, GDK_BUTTON_PRESS_MASK);

  gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT(drawingarea), "event", 
    (GtkSignalFunc)area_event, (gpointer)drawingarea);
  
  /* Add drawingarea to window, then show them both */

  gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER(window), drawingarea);

  gtk_widget_show (drawingarea);
  gtk_widget_show (window);
  
  /* Enter the gtk main loop (this never returns) */

  gtk_main ();

  /* Satisfy grumpy compilers */

  return(0);

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1> File Selections
<p>
The file selection widget is a quick and simple way to display a File
dialog box. It comes complete with Ok, Cancel, and Help buttons, a
great way to cut down on programming time.

To create a new file selection box use:

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_file_selection_new( gchar *title );
</verb></tscreen>

To set the filename, for example to bring up a specific directory, or
give a default filename, use this function:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_file_selection_set_filename( GtkFileSelection *filesel,
                                      gchar            *filename );
</verb></tscreen>

To grab the text that the user has entered or clicked on, use this 
function:

<tscreen><verb>
gchar *gtk_file_selection_get_filename( GtkFileSelection *filesel );
</verb></tscreen>

There are also pointers to the widgets contained within the file 
selection widget. These are:

<tscreen><verb>
  dir_list
  file_list
  selection_entry
  selection_text
  main_vbox
  ok_button
  cancel_button
  help_button
</verb></tscreen>
 
Most likely you will want to use the ok_button, cancel_button, and
help_button pointers in signaling their use.

Included here is an example stolen from testgtk.c, modified to run on
its own. As you will see, there is nothing much to creating a file
selection widget. While in this example the Help button appears on the
screen, it does nothing as there is not a signal attached to it.

<tscreen><verb>
/* example-start filesel filesel.c */

#include <gtk/gtk.h>

/* Get the selected filename and print it to the console */
void file_ok_sel( GtkWidget        *w,
                  GtkFileSelection *fs )
{
    g_print ("%s\n", gtk_file_selection_get_filename (GTK_FILE_SELECTION (fs)));
}

void destroy( GtkWidget *widget,
              gpointer   data )
{
    gtk_main_quit ();
}

int main( int   argc,
          char *argv[] )
{
    GtkWidget *filew;
    
    gtk_init (&amp;argc, &amp;argv);
    
    /* Create a new file selection widget */
    filew = gtk_file_selection_new ("File selection");
    
    gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT (filew), "destroy",
			(GtkSignalFunc) destroy, &amp;filew);
    /* Connect the ok_button to file_ok_sel function */
    gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT (GTK_FILE_SELECTION (filew)->ok_button),
			"clicked", (GtkSignalFunc) file_ok_sel, filew );
    
    /* Connect the cancel_button to destroy the widget */
    gtk_signal_connect_object (GTK_OBJECT (GTK_FILE_SELECTION
                                            (filew)->cancel_button),
			       "clicked", (GtkSignalFunc) gtk_widget_destroy,
			       GTK_OBJECT (filew));
    
    /* Lets set the filename, as if this were a save dialog, and we are giving
     a default filename */
    gtk_file_selection_set_filename (GTK_FILE_SELECTION(filew), 
				     "penguin.png");
    
    gtk_widget_show(filew);
    gtk_main ();
    return 0;
}
/* example-end */

<!-- ***************************************************************** -->
<sect> Container Widgets
<!-- ***************************************************************** -->

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->   
<sect1>The EventBox <label id="sec_EventBox">
<p> 
Some GTK widgets don't have associated X windows, so they just draw on
their parents. Because of this, they cannot receive events and if they
are incorrectly sized, they don't clip so you can get messy
overwriting, etc. If you require more from these widgets, the EventBox
is for you.

At first glance, the EventBox widget might appear to be totally
useless. It draws nothing on the screen and responds to no
events. However, it does serve a function - it provides an X window
for its child widget. This is important as many GTK widgets do not
have an associated X window. Not having an X window saves memory and
improves performance, but also has some drawbacks. A widget without an
X window cannot receive events, and does not perform any clipping on
its contents. Although the name <em/EventBox/ emphasizes the
event-handling function, the widget can also be used for clipping.
(and more, see the example below).

To create a new EventBox widget, use:

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_event_box_new( void );
</verb></tscreen>

A child widget can then be added to this EventBox:

<tscreen><verb>
    gtk_container_add( GTK_CONTAINER(event_box), child_widget );
</verb></tscreen>

The following example demonstrates both uses of an EventBox - a label
is created that is clipped to a small box, and set up so that a
mouse-click on the label causes the program to exit. Resizing the
window reveals varying amounts of the label.

<tscreen><verb>
/* example-start eventbox eventbox.c */

#include <gtk/gtk.h>

int main( int argc,
          char *argv[] )
{
    GtkWidget *window;
    GtkWidget *event_box;
    GtkWidget *label;
    
    gtk_init (&amp;argc, &amp;argv);
    
    window = gtk_window_new (GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
    
    gtk_window_set_title (GTK_WINDOW (window), "Event Box");
    
    gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT (window), "destroy",
			GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (gtk_exit), NULL);
    
    gtk_container_set_border_width (GTK_CONTAINER (window), 10);
    
    /* Create an EventBox and add it to our toplevel window */
    
    event_box = gtk_event_box_new ();
    gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER(window), event_box);
    gtk_widget_show (event_box);
    
    /* Create a long label */
    
    label = gtk_label_new ("Click here to quit, quit, quit, quit, quit");
    gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (event_box), label);
    gtk_widget_show (label);
    
    /* Clip it short. */
    gtk_widget_set_usize (label, 110, 20);
    
    /* And bind an action to it */
    gtk_widget_set_events (event_box, GDK_BUTTON_PRESS_MASK);
    gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT(event_box), "button_press_event",
			GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (gtk_exit), NULL);
    
    /* Yet one more thing you need an X window for ... */
    
    gtk_widget_realize (event_box);
    gdk_window_set_cursor (event_box->window, gdk_cursor_new (GDK_HAND1));
    
    gtk_widget_show (window);
    
    gtk_main ();
    
    return(0);
}
/* example-end */
</verb></tscreen>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->   
<sect1>The Alignment widget <label id="sec_Alignment">
<p>
The alignment widget allows you to place a widget within its window at
a position and size relative to the size of the Alignment widget
itself. For example, it can be very useful for centering a widget
within the window.

There are only two functions associated with the Alignment widget:

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget* gtk_alignment_new( gfloat xalign,
                              gfloat yalign,
                              gfloat xscale,
                              gfloat yscale );

void gtk_alignment_set( GtkAlignment *alignment,
                        gfloat        xalign,
                        gfloat        yalign,
                        gfloat        xscale,
                        gfloat        yscale );
</verb></tscreen>

The first function creates a new Alignment widget with the specified
parameters. The second function allows the alignment paramters of an
exisiting Alignment widget to be altered.

All four alignment parameters are floating point numbers which can
range from 0.0 to 1.0. The <tt/xalign/ and <tt/yalign/ arguments
affect the position of the widget placed within the Alignment
widget. The <tt/xscale/ and <tt/yscale/ arguments effect the amount of
space allocated to the widget.

A child widget can be added to this Alignment widget using:

<tscreen><verb>
    gtk_container_add( GTK_CONTAINER(alignment), child_widget );
</verb></tscreen>

For an example of using an Alignment widget, refer to the example for
the <ref id="sec_ProgressBar" name="Progress Bar"> widget.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1> Fixed Container
<p>
The Fixed container allows you to place widgets at a fixed position
within its window, relative to its upper left hand corner. The
position of the widgets can be changed dynamically.

There are only three functions associated with the fixed widget:

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget* gtk_fixed_new( void );

void gtk_fixed_put( GtkFixed  *fixed,
                    GtkWidget *widget,
                    gint16     x,
                    gint16     y );

void gtk_fixed_move( GtkFixed  *fixed,
                     GtkWidget *widget,
                     gint16     x,
                     gint16     y );
</verb></tscreen>

The function <tt/gtk_fixed_new/ allows you to create a new Fixed
container.

<tt/gtk_fixed_put/ places <tt/widget/ in the container <tt/fixed/ at
the position specified by <tt/x/ and <tt/y/.

<tt/gtk_fixed_move/ allows the specified widget to be moved to a new
position.

The following example illustrates how to use the Fixed Container.

<tscreen><verb>
/* example-start fixed fixed.c */

#include <gtk/gtk.h>

/* I'm going to be lazy and use some global variables to
 * store the position of the widget within the fixed
 * container */
gint x=50;
gint y=50;

/* This callback function moves the button to a new position
 * in the Fixed container. */
void move_button( GtkWidget *widget,
                  GtkWidget *fixed )
{
  x = (x+30)%300;
  y = (y+50)%300;
  gtk_fixed_move( GTK_FIXED(fixed), widget, x, y); 
}

int main( int   argc,
          char *argv[] )
{
  /* GtkWidget is the storage type for widgets */
  GtkWidget *window;
  GtkWidget *fixed;
  GtkWidget *button;
  gint i;

  /* Initialise GTK */
  gtk_init(&amp;argc, &amp;argv);
    
  /* Create a new window */
  window = gtk_window_new (GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
  gtk_window_set_title(GTK_WINDOW(window), "Fixed Container");

  /* Here we connect the "destroy" event to a signal handler */ 
  gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT (window), "destroy",
		      GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (gtk_main_quit), NULL);
 
  /* Sets the border width of the window. */
  gtk_container_set_border_width (GTK_CONTAINER (window), 10);

  /* Create a Fixed Container */
  fixed = gtk_fixed_new();
  gtk_container_add(GTK_CONTAINER(window), fixed);
  gtk_widget_show(fixed);
  
  for (i = 1 ; i <= 3 ; i++) {
    /* Creates a new button with the label "Press me" */
    button = gtk_button_new_with_label ("Press me");
  
    /* When the button receives the "clicked" signal, it will call the
     * function move_button() passing it the Fixed Container as its
     * argument. */
    gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT (button), "clicked",
			GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (move_button), fixed);
  
    /* This packs the button into the fixed containers window. */
    gtk_fixed_put (GTK_FIXED (fixed), button, i*50, i*50);
  
    /* The final step is to display this newly created widget. */
    gtk_widget_show (button);
  }

  /* Display the window */
  gtk_widget_show (window);
    
  /* Enter the event loop */
  gtk_main ();
    
  return(0);
}
/* example-end */
</verb></tscreen>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1> Layout Container
<p>
The Layout container is similar to the Fixed container except that it
implements an infinite (where infinity is less than 2^32) scrolling
area. The X window system has a limitation where windows can be at
most 32767 pixels wide or tall. The Layout container gets around this
limitation by doing some exotic stuff using window and bit gravities,
so that you can have smooth scrolling even when you have many child
widgets in your scrolling area.

A Layout container is created using:

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_layout_new( GtkAdjustment *hadjustment,
                           GtkAdjustment *vadjustment );
</verb></tscreen>

As you can see, you can optionally specify the Adjustment objects that
the Layout widget will use for its scrolling.

You can add and move widgets in the Layout container using the
following two functions:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_layout_put( GtkLayout *layout,
                     GtkWidget *widget,
                     gint       x,
                     gint       y );

void gtk_layout_move( GtkLayout *layout,
                      GtkWidget *widget,
                      gint       x,
                      gint       y );
</verb></tscreen>

The size of the Layout container can be set using the next function:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_layout_set_size( GtkLayout *layout,
                          guint      width,
                          guint      height );
</verb></tscreen>

Layout containers are one of the very few widgets in the GTK widget
set that actively repaint themselves on screen as they are changed
using the above functions (the vast majority of widgets queue
requests which are then processed when control returns to the
<tt/gtk_main()/ function).

When you want to make a large number of changes to a Layout container,
you can use the following two functions to disable and re-enable this
repainting functionality:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_layout_freeze( GtkLayout *layout );

void gtk_layout_thaw( GtkLayout *layout );
</verb></tscreen>

The final four functions for use with Layout widgets are for
manipulating the horizontal and vertical adjustment widgets:

<tscreen><verb>
GtkAdjustment* gtk_layout_get_hadjustment( GtkLayout *layout );

GtkAdjustment* gtk_layout_get_vadjustment( GtkLayout *layout );

void gtk_layout_set_hadjustment( GtkLayout     *layout,
                                 GtkAdjustment *adjustment );

void gtk_layout_set_vadjustment( GtkLayout     *layout,
                                 GtkAdjustment *adjustment);
</verb></tscreen>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1> Frames <label id="sec_Frames">
<p>
Frames can be used to enclose one or a group of widgets with a box
which can optionally be labelled. The position of the label and the
style of the box can be altered to suit.

A Frame can be created with the following function:

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_frame_new( const gchar *label );
</verb></tscreen>

The label is by default placed in the upper left hand corner of the
frame. A value of NULL for the <tt/label/ argument will result in no
label being displayed. The text of the label can be changed using the
next function.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_frame_set_label( GtkFrame    *frame,
                          const gchar *label );
</verb></tscreen>

The position of the label can be changed using this function:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_frame_set_label_align( GtkFrame *frame,
                                gfloat    xalign,
                                gfloat    yalign );
</verb></tscreen>

<tt/xalign/ and <tt/yalign/ take values between 0.0 and 1.0. <tt/xalign/
indicates the position of the label along the top horizontal of the
frame. <tt/yalign/ is not currently used. The default value of xalign
is 0.0 which places the label at the left hand end of the frame.

The next function alters the style of the box that is used to outline
the frame.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_frame_set_shadow_type( GtkFrame      *frame,
                                GtkShadowType  type);
</verb></tscreen>

The <tt/type/ argument can take one of the following values:
<tscreen><verb>
  GTK_SHADOW_NONE
  GTK_SHADOW_IN
  GTK_SHADOW_OUT
  GTK_SHADOW_ETCHED_IN (the default)
  GTK_SHADOW_ETCHED_OUT
</verb></tscreen>

The following code example illustrates the use of the Frame widget.

<tscreen><verb>
/* example-start frame frame.c */

#include <gtk/gtk.h>

int main( int   argc,
          char *argv[] )
{
  /* GtkWidget is the storage type for widgets */
  GtkWidget *window;
  GtkWidget *frame;
  GtkWidget *button;
  gint i;

  /* Initialise GTK */
  gtk_init(&amp;argc, &amp;argv);
    
  /* Create a new window */
  window = gtk_window_new (GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
  gtk_window_set_title(GTK_WINDOW(window), "Frame Example");

  /* Here we connect the "destroy" event to a signal handler */ 
  gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT (window), "destroy",
		      GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (gtk_main_quit), NULL);

  gtk_widget_set_usize(window, 300, 300);
  /* Sets the border width of the window. */
  gtk_container_set_border_width (GTK_CONTAINER (window), 10);

  /* Create a Frame */
  frame = gtk_frame_new(NULL);
  gtk_container_add(GTK_CONTAINER(window), frame);

  /* Set the frame's label */
  gtk_frame_set_label( GTK_FRAME(frame), "GTK Frame Widget" );

  /* Align the label at the right of the frame */
  gtk_frame_set_label_align( GTK_FRAME(frame), 1.0, 0.0);

  /* Set the style of the frame */
  gtk_frame_set_shadow_type( GTK_FRAME(frame), GTK_SHADOW_ETCHED_OUT);

  gtk_widget_show(frame);
  
  /* Display the window */
  gtk_widget_show (window);
    
  /* Enter the event loop */
  gtk_main ();
    
  return(0);
}
/* example-end */

<sect1> Aspect Frames
<p>
The aspect frame widget is like a frame widget, except that it also
enforces the aspect ratio (that is, the ratio of the width to the
height) of the child widget to have a certain value, adding extra
space if necessary. This is useful, for instance, if you want to
preview a larger image. The size of the preview should vary when the
user resizes the window, but the aspect ratio needs to always match
the original image.
  
To create a new aspect frame use:
   
<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_aspect_frame_new( const gchar *label,
                                 gfloat       xalign,
                                 gfloat       yalign,
                                 gfloat       ratio,
                                 gint         obey_child);
</verb></tscreen>
   
<tt/xalign/ and <tt/yalign/ specify alignment as with Alignment
widgets. If <tt/obey_child/ is true, the aspect ratio of a child
widget will match the aspect ratio of the ideal size it requests.
Otherwise, it is given by <tt/ratio/.
   
To change the options of an existing aspect frame, you can use:
   
<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_aspect_frame_set( GtkAspectFrame *aspect_frame,
                           gfloat          xalign,
                           gfloat          yalign,
                           gfloat          ratio,
                           gint            obey_child);
</verb></tscreen>
   
As an example, the following program uses an AspectFrame to present a
drawing area whose aspect ratio will always be 2:1, no matter how the
user resizes the top-level window.
   
<tscreen><verb>
/* example-start aspectframe aspectframe.c */

#include <gtk/gtk.h>
   
int main( int argc,
          char *argv[] )

    GtkWidget *window;
    GtkWidget *aspect_frame;
    GtkWidget *drawing_area;
    gtk_init (&amp;argc, &amp;argv);
   
    window = gtk_window_new (GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
    gtk_window_set_title (GTK_WINDOW (window), "Aspect Frame");
    gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT (window), "destroy",
                        GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (gtk_main_quit), NULL);
    gtk_container_set_border_width (GTK_CONTAINER (window), 10);
   
    /* Create an aspect_frame and add it to our toplevel window */
   
    aspect_frame = gtk_aspect_frame_new ("2x1", /* label */
                                         0.5, /* center x */
                                         0.5, /* center y */
                                         2, /* xsize/ysize = 2 */
                                         FALSE /* ignore child's aspect */);
   
    gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER(window), aspect_frame);
    gtk_widget_show (aspect_frame);
   
    /* Now add a child widget to the aspect frame */
   
    drawing_area = gtk_drawing_area_new ();
   
    /* Ask for a 200x200 window, but the AspectFrame will give us a 200x100
     * window since we are forcing a 2x1 aspect ratio */
    gtk_widget_set_usize (drawing_area, 200, 200);
    gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER(aspect_frame), drawing_area);
    gtk_widget_show (drawing_area);

<sect1> Paned Window Widgets
<p>
The paned window widgets are useful when you want to divide an area
into two parts, with the relative size of the two parts controlled by
the user. A groove is drawn between the two portions with a handle
that the user can drag to change the ratio. The division can either be
horizontal (HPaned) or vertical (VPaned).
   
To create a new paned window, call one of:
   
<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_hpaned_new (void);

GtkWidget *gtk_vpaned_new (void);
</verb></tscreen>

After creating the paned window widget, you need to add child widgets
to its two halves. To do this, use the functions:
   
<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_paned_add1 (GtkPaned *paned, GtkWidget *child);

void gtk_paned_add2 (GtkPaned *paned, GtkWidget *child);
</verb></tscreen>
   
<tt/gtk_paned_add1()/ adds the child widget to the left or top half of
the paned window. <tt/gtk_paned_add2()/ adds the child widget to the
right or bottom half of the paned window.

A paned widget can be changed visually using the following two
functions.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_paned_set_handle_size( GtkPaned *paned,
                                guint16   size);

void gtk_paned_set_gutter_size( GtkPaned *paned,
                                guint16   size);
</verb></tscreen>

The first of these sets the size of the handle and the second sets the
size of the gutter that is between the two parts of the paned window.

As an example, we will create part of the user interface of an
imaginary email program. A window is divided into two portions
vertically, with the top portion being a list of email messages and
the bottom portion the text of the email message. Most of the program
is pretty straightforward. A couple of points to note: text can't be
added to a Text widget until it is realized. This could be done by
calling <tt/gtk_widget_realize()/, but as a demonstration of an
alternate technique, we connect a handler to the "realize" signal to
add the text. Also, we need to add the <tt/GTK_SHRINK/ option to some
of the items in the table containing the text window and its
scrollbars, so that when the bottom portion is made smaller, the
correct portions shrink instead of being pushed off the bottom of the
window.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Viewports <label id="sec_Viewports">
<p>
It is unlikely that you will ever need to use the Viewport widget
directly. You are much more likely to use the
<ref id="sec_ScrolledWindow" name="Scrolled Window"> widget which
itself uses the Viewport.

A viewport widget allows you to place a larger widget within it such
that you can view a part of it at a time. It uses
<ref id="sec_Adjustment" name="Adjustments"> to define the area that
is currently in view.

A Viewport is created with the function

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_viewport_new( GtkAdjustment *hadjustment,
                             GtkAdjustment *vadjustment );
</verb></tscreen>

As you can see you can specify the horizontal and vertical Adjustments
that the widget is to use when you create the widget. It will create
its own if you pass NULL as the value of the arguments.

You can get and set the adjustments after the widget has been created
using the following four functions:

<tscreen><verb>
GtkAdjustment *gtk_viewport_get_hadjustment (GtkViewport *viewport );

GtkAdjustment *gtk_viewport_get_vadjustment (GtkViewport *viewport );

void gtk_viewport_set_hadjustment( GtkViewport   *viewport,
                                   GtkAdjustment *adjustment );

void gtk_viewport_set_vadjustment( GtkViewport   *viewport,
                                   GtkAdjustment *adjustment );
</verb></tscreen>

The only other viewport function is used to alter its appearance:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_viewport_set_shadow_type( GtkViewport   *viewport,
                                   GtkShadowType  type );
</verb></tscreen>

Possible values for the <tt/type/ parameter are:
<tscreen><verb>
  GTK_SHADOW_NONE,
  GTK_SHADOW_IN,
  GTK_SHADOW_OUT,
  GTK_SHADOW_ETCHED_IN,
  GTK_SHADOW_ETCHED_OUT
</verb></tscreen>
 
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Scrolled Windows <label id="sec_ScrolledWindow">
<p>
Scrolled windows are used to create a scrollable area with another
widget inside it. You may insert any type of widget into a scrolled
window, and it will be accessible regardless of the size by using the
scrollbars.

The following function is used to create a new scrolled window.

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_scrolled_window_new( GtkAdjustment *hadjustment,
                                    GtkAdjustment *vadjustment );
</verb></tscreen>

Where the first argument is the adjustment for the horizontal
direction, and the second, the adjustment for the vertical direction.
These are almost always set to NULL.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_scrolled_window_set_policy( GtkScrolledWindow *scrolled_window,
                                     GtkPolicyType      hscrollbar_policy,
                                     GtkPolicyType      vscrollbar_policy );
</verb></tscreen>

This sets the policy to be used with respect to the scrollbars.
The first argument is the scrolled window you wish to change. The second
sets the policy for the horizontal scrollbar, and the third the policy for 
the vertical scrollbar.

The policy may be one of <tt/GTK_POLICY_AUTOMATIC/ or
<tt/GTK_POLICY_ALWAYS/. <tt/GTK_POLICY_AUTOMATIC/ will automatically
decide whether you need scrollbars, whereas <tt/GTK_POLICY_ALWAYS/
will always leave the scrollbars there.

You can then place your object into the scrolled window using the
following function.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_scrolled_window_add_with_viewport( GtkScrolledWindow *scrolled_window,
                                            GtkWidget         *child);
</verb></tscreen>

    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)

          gtk_widget_show (button);
       }
    
    /* Add a "close" button to the bottom of the dialog */
    button = gtk_button_new_with_label ("close");

    gtk_widget_show (window);
    
    gtk_main();
    
    return(0);
}
/* example-end */
</verb></tscreen>

Try playing with resizing the window. You'll notice how the scrollbars
react. You may also wish to use the gtk_widget_set_usize() call to set
the default size of the window or other widgets.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->   
<sect1>Button Boxes
<p>
Button Boxes are a convenient way to quickly layout a group of
buttons. They come in both horizontal and vertical flavours. You
create a new Button Box with one of the following calls, which create
a horizontal or vertical box, respectively:

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_hbutton_box_new( void );

GtkWidget *gtk_vbutton_box_new( void );
</verb></tscreen>

The only attributes pertaining to button boxes effect how the buttons
are laid out. You can change the spacing between the buttons with:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_hbutton_box_set_spacing_default( gint spacing );

void gtk_vbutton_box_set_spacing_default( gint spacing );
</verb></tscreen>

Similarly, the current spacing values can be queried using:

<tscreen><verb>
gint gtk_hbutton_box_get_spacing_default( void );

gint gtk_vbutton_box_get_spacing_default( void );
</verb></tscreen>

The second attribute that we can access effects the layout of the
buttons within the box. It is set using one of:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_hbutton_box_set_layout_default( GtkButtonBoxStyle layout );

void gtk_vbutton_box_set_layout_default( GtkButtonBoxStyle layout );
</verb></tscreen>

The <tt/layout/ argument can take one of the following values:

<tscreen><verb>
  GTK_BUTTONBOX_DEFAULT_STYLE
  GTK_BUTTONBOX_SPREAD
  GTK_BUTTONBOX_EDGE
  GTK_BUTTONBOX_START
  GTK_BUTTONBOX_END
</verb></tscreen>

The current layout setting can be retrieved using:

<tscreen><verb>
GtkButtonBoxStyle gtk_hbutton_box_get_layout_default( void );

GtkButtonBoxStyle gtk_vbutton_box_get_layout_default( void );
</verb></tscreen>

Buttons are added to a Button Box using the usual function:

<tscreen><verb>
    gtk_container_add( GTK_CONTAINER(button_box), child_widget );
</verb></tscreen>

Here's an example that illustrates all the different layout settings
for Button Boxes.

<tscreen><verb>
/* example-start buttonbox buttonbox.c */

<sect1>Toolbar
<p>
Toolbars are usually used to group some number of widgets in order to
simplify customization of their look and layout. Typically a toolbar
consists of buttons with icons, labels and tooltips, but any other
widget can also be put inside a toolbar. Finally, items can be
arranged horizontally or vertically and buttons can be displayed with
icons, labels, or both.

Creating a toolbar is (as one may already suspect) done with the
following function:

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_toolbar_new( GtkOrientation orientation,
                            GtkToolbarStyle  style );
</verb></tscreen>

where orientation may be one of:

<tscreen><verb>
  GTK_ORIENTATION_HORIZONTAL    
  GTK_ORIENTATION_VERTICAL
</verb></tscreen>

and style one of:

<tscreen><verb>
  GTK_TOOLBAR_TEXT
  GTK_TOOLBAR_ICONS
  GTK_TOOLBAR_BOTH
</verb></tscreen>

The style applies to all the buttons created with the `item' functions
(not to buttons inserted into toolbar as separate widgets).

After creating a toolbar one can append, prepend and insert items
(that means simple text strings) or elements (that means any widget
types) into the toolbar. To describe an item we need a label text, a
tooltip text, a private tooltip text, an icon for the button and a
callback function for it. For example, to append or prepend an item
you may use the following functions:

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_toolbar_append_item( GtkToolbar    *toolbar,
                                    const char    *text,
                                    const char    *tooltip_text,
                                    const char    *tooltip_private_text,
                                    GtkWidget     *icon,
                                    GtkSignalFunc  callback,
                                    gpointer       user_data );

GtkWidget *gtk_toolbar_prepend_item( GtkToolbar    *toolbar,
                                     const char    *text,
                                     const char    *tooltip_text,
                                     const char    *tooltip_private_text,
                                     GtkWidget     *icon,
                                     GtkSignalFunc  callback,
                                     gpointer       user_data );
</verb></tscreen>

If you want to use gtk_toolbar_insert_item, the only additional
parameter which must be specified is the position in which the item
should be inserted, thus:

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_toolbar_insert_item( GtkToolbar    *toolbar,
                                    const char    *text,
                                    const char    *tooltip_text,
                                    const char    *tooltip_private_text,
                                    GtkWidget     *icon,
                                    GtkSignalFunc  callback,
                                    gpointer       user_data,
                                    gint           position );
</verb></tscreen>

To simplify adding spaces between toolbar items, you may use the
following functions:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_toolbar_append_space( GtkToolbar *toolbar );

void gtk_toolbar_prepend_space( GtkToolbar *toolbar );

void gtk_toolbar_insert_space( GtkToolbar *toolbar,
                               gint        position );
 
</verb></tscreen>

While the size of the added space can be set globally for a
whole toolbar with the function:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_toolbar_set_space_size( GtkToolbar *toolbar,
                                 gint        space_size) ;
</verb></tscreen>

If it's required, the orientation of a toolbar and its style can be
changed "on the fly" using the following functions:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_toolbar_set_orientation( GtkToolbar     *toolbar,
                                  GtkOrientation  orientation );

void gtk_toolbar_set_style( GtkToolbar      *toolbar,
                            GtkToolbarStyle  style );

void gtk_toolbar_set_tooltips( GtkToolbar *toolbar,
                               gint        enable );
</verb></tscreen>

Where <tt/orientation/ is one of <tt/GTK_ORIENTATION_HORIZONTAL/ or
<tt/GTK_ORIENTATION_VERTICAL/. The <tt/style/ is used to set
appearance of the toolbar items by using one of
<tt/GTK_TOOLBAR_ICONS/, <tt/GTK_TOOLBAR_TEXT/, or
<tt/GTK_TOOLBAR_BOTH/.

To show some other things that can be done with a toolbar, let's take
the following program (we'll interrupt the listing with some
additional explanations):

<tscreen><verb>
#include <gtk/gtk.h>

#include "gtk.xpm"

/* This function is connected to the Close button or
 * closing the window from the WM */
gint delete_event (GtkWidget *widget, GdkEvent *event, gpointer data)
{
  gtk_main_quit ();
  return(FALSE);
}
</verb></tscreen>

The above beginning seems for sure familiar to you if it's not your first
GTK program. There is one additional thing though, we include a nice XPM
picture to serve as an icon for all of the buttons.

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget* close_button; /* This button will emit signal to close
                          * application */
GtkWidget* tooltips_button; /* to enable/disable tooltips */
GtkWidget* text_button,
         * icon_button,
         * both_button; /* radio buttons for toolbar style */
GtkWidget* entry; /* a text entry to show packing any widget into
                   * toolbar */
</verb></tscreen>

In fact not all of the above widgets are needed here, but to make things
clearer I put them all together.

<tscreen><verb>
/* that's easy... when one of the buttons is toggled, we just
 * check which one is active and set the style of the toolbar
 * accordingly
 * ATTENTION: our toolbar is passed as data to callback ! */
void radio_event (GtkWidget *widget, gpointer data)
{
  if (GTK_TOGGLE_BUTTON (text_button)->active) 
    gtk_toolbar_set_style(GTK_TOOLBAR ( data ), GTK_TOOLBAR_TEXT);
  else if (GTK_TOGGLE_BUTTON (icon_button)->active)
    gtk_toolbar_set_style(GTK_TOOLBAR ( data ), GTK_TOOLBAR_ICONS);
  else if (GTK_TOGGLE_BUTTON (both_button)->active)
    gtk_toolbar_set_style(GTK_TOOLBAR ( data ), GTK_TOOLBAR_BOTH);
}

/* even easier, just check given toggle button and enable/disable 
 * tooltips */
void toggle_event (GtkWidget *widget, gpointer data)
{
  gtk_toolbar_set_tooltips (GTK_TOOLBAR ( data ),
                            GTK_TOGGLE_BUTTON (widget)->active );
}
</verb></tscreen>

The above are just two callback functions that will be called when
one of the buttons on a toolbar is pressed. You should already be
familiar with things like this if you've already used toggle buttons (and
radio buttons).

<tscreen><verb>
int main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
  /* Here is our main window (a dialog) and a handle for the handlebox */
  GtkWidget* dialog;
  GtkWidget* handlebox;

  /* Ok, we need a toolbar, an icon with a mask (one for all of 
     the buttons) and an icon widget to put this icon in (but 
     we'll create a separate widget for each button) */
  GtkWidget * toolbar;
  GdkPixmap * icon;
  GdkBitmap * mask;
  GtkWidget * iconw;

  /* this is called in all GTK application. */
  gtk_init (&amp;argc, &amp;argv);
  
  /* create a new window with a given title, and nice size */
  dialog = gtk_dialog_new ();
  gtk_window_set_title ( GTK_WINDOW ( dialog ) , "GTKToolbar Tutorial");
  gtk_widget_set_usize( GTK_WIDGET ( dialog ) , 600 , 300 );
  GTK_WINDOW ( dialog ) ->allow_shrink = TRUE;

  /* typically we quit if someone tries to close us */
  gtk_signal_connect ( GTK_OBJECT ( dialog ), "delete_event",
                       GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC ( delete_event ), NULL);

  /* we need to realize the window because we use pixmaps for 
   * items on the toolbar in the context of it */
  gtk_widget_realize ( dialog );

  /* to make it nice we'll put the toolbar into the handle box, 
   * so that it can be detached from the main window */
  handlebox = gtk_handle_box_new ();
  gtk_box_pack_start ( GTK_BOX ( GTK_DIALOG(dialog)->vbox ),
                       handlebox, FALSE, FALSE, 5 );
</verb></tscreen>

The above should be similar to any other GTK application. Just
initialization of GTK, creating the window, etc. There is only one
thing that probably needs some explanation: a handle box. A handle box
is just another box that can be used to pack widgets in to. The
difference between it and typical boxes is that it can be detached
from a parent window (or, in fact, the handle box remains in the
parent, but it is reduced to a very small rectangle, while all of its
contents are reparented to a new freely floating window). It is
usually nice to have a detachable toolbar, so these two widgets occur
together quite often.

<tscreen><verb>
  /* toolbar will be horizontal, with both icons and text, and
   * with 5pxl spaces between items and finally, 
   * we'll also put it into our handlebox */
  toolbar = gtk_toolbar_new ( GTK_ORIENTATION_HORIZONTAL,
                              GTK_TOOLBAR_BOTH );
  gtk_container_set_border_width ( GTK_CONTAINER ( toolbar ) , 5 );
  gtk_toolbar_set_space_size ( GTK_TOOLBAR ( toolbar ), 5 );
  gtk_container_add ( GTK_CONTAINER ( handlebox ) , toolbar );

  /* now we create icon with mask: we'll reuse it to create
   * icon widgets for toolbar items */
  icon = gdk_pixmap_create_from_xpm_d ( dialog->window, &amp;mask,
      &amp;dialog->style->white, gtk_xpm );
</verb></tscreen>

Well, what we do above is just a straightforward initialization of
the toolbar widget and creation of a GDK pixmap with its mask. If you
want to know something more about using pixmaps, refer to GDK
documentation or to the <ref id="sec_Pixmaps" name="Pixmaps"> section
earlier in this tutorial.

<tscreen><verb>
  /* our first item is <close> button */
  iconw = gtk_pixmap_new ( icon, mask ); /* icon widget */
  close_button = 
    gtk_toolbar_append_item ( GTK_TOOLBAR (toolbar), /* our toolbar */
                              "Close",               /* button label */
                              "Closes this app",     /* this button's tooltip */
                              "Private",             /* tooltip private info */
                              iconw,                 /* icon widget */
                              GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (delete_event), /* a signal */
                               NULL );
  gtk_toolbar_append_space ( GTK_TOOLBAR ( toolbar ) ); /* space after item */
</verb></tscreen>

In the above code you see the simplest case: adding a button to
toolbar.  Just before appending a new item, we have to construct a
pixmap widget to serve as an icon for this item; this step will have
to be repeated for each new item. Just after the item we also add a
space, so the following items will not touch each other. As you see
gtk_toolbar_append_item returns a pointer to our newly created button
widget, so that we can work with it in the normal way.

<tscreen><verb>
  /* now, let's make our radio buttons group... */
  iconw = gtk_pixmap_new ( icon, mask );
  icon_button = gtk_toolbar_append_element(
                    GTK_TOOLBAR(toolbar),
                    GTK_TOOLBAR_CHILD_RADIOBUTTON, /* a type of element */
                    NULL,                          /* pointer to widget */
                    "Icon",                        /* label */
                    "Only icons in toolbar",       /* tooltip */
                    "Private",                     /* tooltip private string */
                    iconw,                         /* icon */
                    GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (radio_event), /* signal */
                    toolbar);                      /* data for signal */
  gtk_toolbar_append_space ( GTK_TOOLBAR ( toolbar ) );
</verb></tscreen>

Here we begin creating a radio buttons group. To do this we use
gtk_toolbar_append_element.  In fact, using this function one can also
+add simple items or even spaces (type = <tt/GTK_TOOLBAR_CHILD_SPACE/
or +<tt/GTK_TOOLBAR_CHILD_BUTTON/). In the above case we start
creating a radio group. In creating other radio buttons for this group
a pointer to the previous button in the group is required, so that a
list of buttons can be easily constructed (see the section on <ref
id="sec_Radio_Buttons" name="Radio Buttons"> earlier in this
tutorial).

<tscreen><verb>
  /* following radio buttons refer to previous ones */
  iconw = gtk_pixmap_new ( icon, mask );
  text_button = 
    gtk_toolbar_append_element(GTK_TOOLBAR(toolbar),
                               GTK_TOOLBAR_CHILD_RADIOBUTTON,
                               icon_button,
                               "Text",
                               "Only texts in toolbar",
                               "Private",
                               iconw,
                               GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (radio_event),
                               toolbar);
  gtk_toolbar_append_space ( GTK_TOOLBAR ( toolbar ) );
                                          
  iconw = gtk_pixmap_new ( icon, mask );
  both_button = 
    gtk_toolbar_append_element(GTK_TOOLBAR(toolbar),
                               GTK_TOOLBAR_CHILD_RADIOBUTTON,
                               text_button,
                               "Both",
                               "Icons and text in toolbar",
                               "Private",
                               iconw,
                               GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (radio_event),
                               toolbar);
  gtk_toolbar_append_space ( GTK_TOOLBAR ( toolbar ) );
  gtk_toggle_button_set_active(GTK_TOGGLE_BUTTON(both_button),TRUE);
</verb></tscreen>

In the end we have to set the state of one of the buttons manually
(otherwise they all stay in active state, preventing us from switching
between them).

<tscreen><verb>
  /* here we have just a simple toggle button */
  iconw = gtk_pixmap_new ( icon, mask );
  tooltips_button = 
    gtk_toolbar_append_element(GTK_TOOLBAR(toolbar),
                               GTK_TOOLBAR_CHILD_TOGGLEBUTTON,
                               NULL,
                               "Tooltips",
                               "Toolbar with or without tips",
                               "Private",
                               iconw,
                               GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (toggle_event),
                               toolbar);
  gtk_toolbar_append_space ( GTK_TOOLBAR ( toolbar ) );
  gtk_toggle_button_set_active(GTK_TOGGLE_BUTTON(tooltips_button),TRUE);
</verb></tscreen>

A toggle button can be created in the obvious way (if one knows how to create
radio buttons already).

<tscreen><verb>
  /* to pack a widget into toolbar, we only have to 
   * create it and append it with an appropriate tooltip */
  entry = gtk_entry_new ();
  gtk_toolbar_append_widget( GTK_TOOLBAR (toolbar), 
                             entry, 
                             "This is just an entry", 
                             "Private" );

  /* well, it isn't created within thetoolbar, so we must still show it */
  gtk_widget_show ( entry );
</verb></tscreen>

As you see, adding any kind of widget to a toolbar is simple. The
one thing you have to remember is that this widget must be shown manually
(contrary to other items which will be shown together with the toolbar).

<tscreen><verb>
  /* that's it ! let's show everything. */
  gtk_widget_show ( toolbar );
  gtk_widget_show (handlebox);
  gtk_widget_show ( dialog );

  /* rest in gtk_main and wait for the fun to begin! */
  gtk_main ();
  
  return 0;
}
</verb></tscreen>

So, here we are at the end of toolbar tutorial. Of course, to appreciate
it in full you need also this nice XPM icon, so here it is:

<tscreen><verb>
/* XPM */
static char * gtk_xpm[] = {
"32 39 5 1",

<sect1> Notebooks
<p>
The NoteBook Widget is a collection of "pages" that overlap each
other, each page contains different information with only one page
visible at a time. This widget has become more common lately in GUI
programming, and it is a good way to show blocks of similar
information that warrant separation in their display.

The first function call you will need to know, as you can probably
guess by now, is used to create a new notebook widget.

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_notebook_new( void );
</verb></tscreen>

Once the notebook has been created, there are a number of functions
that operate on the notebook widget. Let's look at them individually.

The first one we will look at is how to position the page indicators.
These page indicators or "tabs" as they are referred to, can be
positioned in four ways: top, bottom, left, or right.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_notebook_set_tab_pos( GtkNotebook     *notebook,
                               GtkPositionType  pos );
</verb></tscreen>

GtkPositionType will be one of the following, which are pretty self
explanatory:
<tscreen><verb>
  GTK_POS_LEFT
  GTK_POS_RIGHT
  GTK_POS_TOP
  GTK_POS_BOTTOM
</verb></tscreen>

<tt/GTK_POS_TOP/ is the default.

Next we will look at how to add pages to the notebook. There are three
ways to add pages to the NoteBook. Let's look at the first two
together as they are quite similar.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_notebook_append_page( GtkNotebook *notebook,
                               GtkWidget   *child,
                               GtkWidget   *tab_label );

void gtk_notebook_prepend_page( GtkNotebook *notebook,
                                GtkWidget   *child,
                                GtkWidget   *tab_label );
</verb></tscreen>

These functions add pages to the notebook by inserting them from the
back of the notebook (append), or the front of the notebook (prepend).
<tt/child/ is the widget that is placed within the notebook page, and
<tt/tab_label/ is the label for the page being added. The <tt/child/
widget must be created separately, and is typically a set of options
setup witin one of the other container widgets, such as a table.

The final function for adding a page to the notebook contains all of
the properties of the previous two, but it allows you to specify what
position you want the page to be in the notebook.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_notebook_insert_page( GtkNotebook *notebook,
                               GtkWidget   *child,
                               GtkWidget   *tab_label,
                               gint         position );
</verb></tscreen>

The parameters are the same as _append_ and _prepend_ except it
contains an extra parameter, <tt/position/.  This parameter is used to
specify what place this page will be inserted into the first page
having position zero.

Now that we know how to add a page, lets see how we can remove a page
from the notebook.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_notebook_remove_page( GtkNotebook *notebook,
                               gint         page_num );
</verb></tscreen>

This function takes the page specified by <tt/page_num/ and removes it
from the widget pointed to by <tt/notebook/.

To find out what the current page is in a notebook use the function:

<tscreen><verb>
gint gtk_notebook_get_current_page( GtkNotebook *notebook );
</verb></tscreen>

These next two functions are simple calls to move the notebook page
forward or backward. Simply provide the respective function call with
the notebook widget you wish to operate on. Note: When the NoteBook is
currently on the last page, and gtk_notebook_next_page is called, the
notebook will wrap back to the first page. Likewise, if the NoteBook
is on the first page, and gtk_notebook_prev_page is called, the
notebook will wrap to the last page.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_notebook_next_page( GtkNoteBook *notebook );

void gtk_notebook_prev_page( GtkNoteBook *notebook );
</verb></tscreen>

This next function sets the "active" page. If you wish the notebook to
be opened to page 5 for example, you would use this function.  Without
using this function, the notebook defaults to the first page.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_notebook_set_page( GtkNotebook *notebook,
                            gint         page_num );
</verb></tscreen>

The next two functions add or remove the notebook page tabs and the
notebook border respectively.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_notebook_set_show_tabs( GtkNotebook *notebook,
                                 gboolean     show_tabs);

void gtk_notebook_set_show_border( GtkNotebook *notebook,
                                   gboolean     show_border );
</verb></tscreen>

The next function is useful when the you have a large number of pages,
and the tabs don't fit on the page. It allows the tabs to be scrolled
through using two arrow buttons.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_notebook_set_scrollable( GtkNotebook *notebook,
                                  gboolean     scrollable );
</verb></tscreen>

<tt/show_tabs/, <tt/show_border/ and <tt/scrollable/ can be either
TRUE or FALSE.

Now let's look at an example, it is expanded from the testgtk.c code
that comes with the GTK distribution. This small program creates a
window with a notebook and six buttons. The notebook contains 11
pages, added in three different ways, appended, inserted, and
prepended. The buttons allow you rotate the tab positions, add/remove
the tabs and border, remove a page, change pages in both a forward and
backward manner, and exit the program.

<tscreen><verb>
/* example-start notebook notebook.c */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <gtk/gtk.h>

/* This function rotates the position of the tabs */
void rotate_book( GtkButton   *button,
                  GtkNotebook *notebook )
{
    gtk_notebook_set_tab_pos (notebook, (notebook->tab_pos +1) %4);
}

/* Add/Remove the page tabs and the borders */
void tabsborder_book( GtkButton   *button,
                      GtkNotebook *notebook )
{
    gint tval = FALSE;
    gint bval = FALSE;
    if (notebook->show_tabs == 0)
	    tval = TRUE; 
    if (notebook->show_border == 0)
	    bval = TRUE;
    
    gtk_notebook_set_show_tabs (notebook, tval);
    gtk_notebook_set_show_border (notebook, bval);
}

/* Remove a page from the notebook */
void remove_book( GtkButton   *button,
                  GtkNotebook *notebook )
{
    gint page;
    
    page = gtk_notebook_get_current_page(notebook);
    gtk_notebook_remove_page (notebook, page);

    gtk_widget_draw(GTK_WIDGET(notebook), NULL);

I hope this helps you on your way with creating notebooks for your
GTK applications.

<!-- ***************************************************************** -->
<sect>CList Widget
<!-- ***************************************************************** -->

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<p>
The CList widget has replaced the List widget (which is still
available).

The CList widget is a multi-column list widget that is capable of
handling literally thousands of rows of information. Each column can
optionally have a title, which itself is optionally active, allowing
us to bind a function to its selection.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Creating a CList widget
<p>
Creating a CList is quite straightforward, once you have learned
about widgets in general. It provides the almost standard two ways,
that is the hard way, and the easy way. But before we create it, there
is one thing we should figure out beforehand: how many columns should
it have?

Not all columns have to be visible and can be used to store data that
is related to a certain cell in the list.

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_clist_new ( gint columns );

GtkWidget *gtk_clist_new_with_titles( gint   columns,
                                      gchar *titles[] );
</verb></tscreen>

The first form is very straightforward, the second might require some
explanation. Each column can have a title associated with it, and this
title can be a label or a button that reacts when we click on it. If
we use the second form, we must provide pointers to the title texts,
and the number of pointers should equal the number of columns
specified. Of course we can always use the first form, and manually
add titles later.

Note: The CList widget does not have its own scrollbars and should
be placed within a ScrolledWindow widget if your require this
functionality. This is a change from the GTK 1.0 implementation.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Modes of operation
<p>
There are several attributes that can be used to alter the behaviour of
a CList. First there is

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_clist_set_selection_mode( GtkCList         *clist,
                                   GtkSelectionMode  mode );
</verb></tscreen>

which, as the name implies, sets the selection mode of the
CList. The first argument is the CList widget, and the second
specifies the cell selection mode (they are defined in gtkenums.h). At
the time of this writing, the following modes are available to us:

<itemize>
<item> <tt/GTK_SELECTION_SINGLE/ - The selection is either NULL or contains
a GList pointer for a single selected item.

<item> <tt/GTK_SELECTION_BROWSE/ - The selection is NULL if the list
contains no widgets or insensitive ones only, otherwise it contains a
GList pointer for one GList structure, and therefore exactly one list
item.

<item> <tt/GTK_SELECTION_MULTIPLE/ - The selection is NULL if no list items
are selected or a GList pointer for the first selected item. That in
turn points to a GList structure for the second selected item and so
on. This is currently the <bf>default</bf> for the CList widget.

<item> <tt/GTK_SELECTION_EXTENDED/ - The selection is always NULL.
</itemize>

Others might be added in later revisions of GTK.

We can also define what the border of the CList widget should look
like. It is done through

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_clist_set_shadow_type( GtkCList      *clist,
                                GtkShadowType  border );
</verb></tscreen>

The possible values for the second argument are

<tscreen><verb>
  GTK_SHADOW_NONE
  GTK_SHADOW_IN
  GTK_SHADOW_OUT
  GTK_SHADOW_ETCHED_IN
  GTK_SHADOW_ETCHED_OUT
</verb></tscreen>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Working with titles
<p>
When you create a CList widget, you will also get a set of title
buttons automatically. They live in the top of the CList window, and
can act either as normal buttons that respond to being pressed, or
they can be passive, in which case they are nothing more than a
title. There are four different calls that aid us in setting the
status of the title buttons.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_clist_column_title_active( GtkCList *clist,
                                     gint     column );

void gtk_clist_column_title_passive( GtkCList *clist,
                                     gint      column );

void gtk_clist_column_titles_active( GtkCList *clist );

void gtk_clist_column_titles_passive( GtkCList *clist );
</verb></tscreen>

An active title is one which acts as a normal button, a passive one is
just a label. The first two calls above will activate/deactivate the
title button above the specific column, while the last two calls
activate/deactivate all title buttons in the supplied clist widget.

But of course there are those cases when we don't want them at all,
and so they can be hidden and shown at will using the following two
calls.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_clist_column_titles_show( GtkCList *clist );

void gtk_clist_column_titles_hide( GtkCList *clist );
</verb></tscreen>

For titles to be really useful we need a mechanism to set and change
them, and this is done using

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_clist_set_column_title( GtkCList *clist,
                                 gint      column,
                                 gchar    *title );
</verb></tscreen>

Note that only the title of one column can be set at a time, so if all
the titles are known from the beginning, then I really suggest using
gtk_clist_new_with_titles (as described above) to set them. It saves
you coding time, and makes your program smaller. There are some cases
where getting the job done the manual way is better, and that's when
not all titles will be text. CList provides us with title buttons
that can in fact incorporate whole widgets, for example a pixmap. It's
all done through

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_clist_set_column_widget( GtkCList  *clist,
                                  gint       column,
                                  GtkWidget *widget );
</verb></tscreen>

which should require no special explanation.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Manipulating the list itself
<p>
It is possible to change the justification for a column, and it is
done through

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_clist_set_column_justification( GtkCList         *clist,
                                         gint              column,
                                         GtkJustification  justification );
</verb></tscreen>

The GtkJustification type can take the following values:

<itemize>
<item><tt/GTK_JUSTIFY_LEFT/ - The text in the column will begin from the
left edge.

<item><tt/GTK_JUSTIFY_RIGHT/ - The text in the column will begin from the
right edge.

<item><tt/GTK_JUSTIFY_CENTER/ - The text is placed in the center of the
column.

<item><tt/GTK_JUSTIFY_FILL/ - The text will use up all available space in
the column. It is normally done by inserting extra blank spaces
between words (or between individual letters if it's a single
word). Much in the same way as any ordinary WYSIWYG text editor.
</itemize>

The next function is a very important one, and should be standard in
the setup of all CList widgets. When the list is created, the width
of the various columns are chosen to match their titles, and since
this is seldom the right width we have to set it using

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_clist_set_column_width( GtkCList *clist,
                                 gint      column,
                                 gint      width );
</verb></tscreen>

Note that the width is given in pixels and not letters. The same goes
for the height of the cells in the columns, but as the default value
is the height of the current font this isn't as critical to the
application. Still, it is done through

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_clist_set_row_height( GtkCList *clist,
                               gint      height );
</verb></tscreen>

Again, note that the height is given in pixels.

We can also move the list around without user interaction, however, it
does require that we know what we are looking for. Or in other words,
we need the row and column of the item we want to scroll to.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_clist_moveto( GtkCList *clist,
                       gint      row,
                       gint      column,
                       gfloat    row_align,
                       gfloat    col_align );
</verb></tscreen>

The gfloat row_align is pretty important to understand. It's a value
between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 means that we should scroll the list so
the row appears at the top, while if the value of row_align is 1.0,
the row will appear at the bottom instead. All other values between
0.0 and 1.0 are also valid and will place the row between the top and
the bottom. The last argument, gfloat col_align works in the same way,
though 0.0 marks left and 1.0 marks right instead.

Depending on the application's needs, we don't have to scroll to an
item that is already visible to us. So how do we know if it is
visible? As usual, there is a function to find that out as well.

<tscreen><verb>
GtkVisibility gtk_clist_row_is_visible( GtkCList *clist,
                                        gint      row );
</verb></tscreen>

The return value is is one of the following:

<tscreen><verb>
  GTK_VISIBILITY_NONE
  GTK_VISIBILITY_PARTIAL
  GTK_VISIBILITY_FULL
</verb></tscreen>

Note that it will only tell us if a row is visible. Currently there is
no way to determine this for a column. We can get partial information
though, because if the return is <tt/GTK_VISIBILITY_PARTIAL/, then
some of it is hidden, but we don't know if it is the row that is being
cut by the lower edge of the listbox, or if the row has columns that
are outside.

We can also change both the foreground and background colors of a
particular row. This is useful for marking the row selected by the
user, and the two functions that is used to do it are

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_clist_set_foreground( GtkCList *clist,
                               gint      row,
                               GdkColor *color );

void gtk_clist_set_background( GtkCList *clist,
                               gint      row,
                               GdkColor *color );
</verb></tscreen>

Please note that the colors must have been previously allocated.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Adding rows to the list
<p>
We can add rows in three ways. They can be prepended or appended to
the list using

<tscreen><verb>
gint gtk_clist_prepend( GtkCList *clist,
                        gchar    *text[] );

gint gtk_clist_append( GtkCList *clist,
                       gchar    *text[] );
</verb></tscreen>

The return value of these two functions indicate the index of the row
that was just added. We can insert a row at a given place using

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_clist_insert( GtkCList *clist,
                       gint      row,
                       gchar    *text[] );
</verb></tscreen>

In these calls we have to provide a collection of pointers that are
the texts we want to put in the columns. The number of pointers should
equal the number of columns in the list. If the text[] argument is
NULL, then there will be no text in the columns of the row. This is
useful, for example, if we want to add pixmaps instead (something that
has to be done manually).

Also, please note that the numbering of both rows and columns start at 0.

To remove an individual row we use

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_clist_remove( GtkCList *clist,
                       gint      row );
</verb></tscreen>

There is also a call that removes all rows in the list. This is a lot
faster than calling gtk_clist_remove once for each row, which is the
only alternative.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_clist_clear( GtkCList *clist );
</verb></tscreen>

There are also two convenience functions that should be used when a
lot of changes have to be made to the list. This is to prevent the
list flickering while being repeatedly updated, which may be highly
annoying to the user. So instead it is a good idea to freeze the list,
do the updates to it, and finally thaw it which causes the list to be
updated on the screen.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_clist_freeze( GtkCList * clist );

void gtk_clist_thaw( GtkCList * clist );
</verb></tscreen>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Setting text and pixmaps in the cells
<p>
A cell can contain a pixmap, text or both. To set them the following
functions are used.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_clist_set_text( GtkCList    *clist,
                         gint         row,
                         gint         column,
                         const gchar *text );

void gtk_clist_set_pixmap( GtkCList  *clist,
                           gint       row,
                           gint       column,
                           GdkPixmap *pixmap,
                           GdkBitmap *mask );

void gtk_clist_set_pixtext( GtkCList  *clist,
                            gint       row,
                            gint       column,
                            gchar     *text,
                            guint8     spacing,
                            GdkPixmap *pixmap,
                            GdkBitmap *mask );
</verb></tscreen>

It's quite straightforward. All the calls have the CList as the first
argument, followed by the row and column of the cell, followed by the
data to be set. The <tt/spacing/ argument in gtk_clist_set_pixtext is
the number of pixels between the pixmap and the beginning of the
text. In all cases the data is copied into the widget.

To read back the data, we instead use

<tscreen><verb>
gint gtk_clist_get_text( GtkCList  *clist,
                         gint       row,
                         gint       column,
                         gchar    **text );

gint gtk_clist_get_pixmap( GtkCList   *clist,
                           gint        row,
                           gint        column,
                           GdkPixmap **pixmap,
                           GdkBitmap **mask );

gint gtk_clist_get_pixtext( GtkCList   *clist,
                            gint        row,
                            gint        column,
                            gchar     **text,
                            guint8     *spacing,
                            GdkPixmap **pixmap,
                            GdkBitmap **mask );
</verb></tscreen>

The returned pointers are all pointers to the data stored within the
widget, so the referenced data should not be modified or released. It
isn't necessary to read it all back in case you aren't interested. Any
of the pointers that are meant for return values (all except the
clist) can be NULL. So if we want to read back only the text from a
cell that is of type pixtext, then we would do the following, assuming
that clist, row and column already exist:

<tscreen><verb>
gchar *mytext;

gtk_clist_get_pixtext(clist, row, column, &amp;mytext, NULL, NULL, NULL);
</verb></tscreen>

There is one more call that is related to what's inside a cell in the
clist, and that's

<tscreen><verb>
GtkCellType gtk_clist_get_cell_type( GtkCList *clist,
                                     gint      row,
                                     gint      column );
</verb></tscreen>

which returns the type of data in a cell. The return value is one of

<tscreen><verb>
  GTK_CELL_EMPTY
  GTK_CELL_TEXT
  GTK_CELL_PIXMAP
  GTK_CELL_PIXTEXT
  GTK_CELL_WIDGET
</verb></tscreen>

There is also a function that will let us set the indentation, both
vertical and horizontal, of a cell. The indentation value is of type
gint, given in pixels, and can be both positive and negative.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_clist_set_shift( GtkCList *clist,
                          gint      row,
                          gint      column,
                          gint      vertical,
                          gint      horizontal );
</verb></tscreen>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Storing data pointers
<p>
With a CList it is possible to set a data pointer for a row. This
pointer will not be visible for the user, but is merely a convenience
for the programmer to associate a row with a pointer to some
additional data.

The functions should be fairly self-explanatory by now.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_clist_set_row_data( GtkCList *clist,
                             gint      row,
                             gpointer  data );

void gtk_clist_set_row_data_full( GtkCList         *clist,
                                  gint              row,
                                  gpointer          data,
                                  GtkDestroyNotify  destroy );

gpointer gtk_clist_get_row_data( GtkCList *clist,
                                 gint      row );

gint gtk_clist_find_row_from_data( GtkCList *clist,
                                   gpointer  data );
</verb></tscreen>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Working with selections
<p>
There are also functions available that let us force the (un)selection
of a row. These are

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_clist_select_row( GtkCList *clist,
                           gint      row,
                           gint      column );

void gtk_clist_unselect_row( GtkCList *clist,
                             gint      row,
                             gint      column );
</verb></tscreen>

And also a function that will take x and y coordinates (for example,
read from the mousepointer), and map that onto the list, returning the
corresponding row and column.

<tscreen><verb>
gint gtk_clist_get_selection_info( GtkCList *clist,
                                   gint      x,
                                   gint      y,
                                   gint     *row,
                                   gint     *column );
</verb></tscreen>

When we detect something of interest (it might be movement of the
pointer, a click somewhere in the list) we can read the pointer
coordinates and find out where in the list the pointer is. Cumbersome?
Luckily, there is a simpler way...

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>The signals that bring it together
<p>
As with all other widgets, there are a few signals that can be used. The
CList widget is derived from the Container widget, and so has all the
same signals, but also adds the following:

<itemize>
<item>select_row - This signal will send the following information, in
order: GtkCList *clist, gint row, gint column, GtkEventButton *event

<item>unselect_row - When the user unselects a row, this signal is
activated. It sends the same information as select_row

<item>click_column - Send GtkCList *clist, gint column
</itemize>

So if we want to connect a callback to select_row, the callback
function would be declared like this

<tscreen><verb>
void select_row_callback(GtkWidget *widget,
                         gint row,
			 gint column,
                         GdkEventButton *event,
			 gpointer data);
</verb></tscreen>

The callback is connected as usual with

<tscreen><verb>
gtk_signal_connect(GTK_OBJECT( clist),
		   "select_row"
		   GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC(select_row_callback),
		   NULL);
</verb></tscreen>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<!-- ***************************************************************** -->
<sect> Tree Widget <label id="sec_Tree_Widgets">
<!-- ***************************************************************** -->
<p>
The purpose of tree widgets is to display hierarchically-organized
data. The Tree widget itself is a vertical container for widgets of
type TreeItem. Tree itself is not terribly different from
CList - both are derived directly from Container, and the
Container methods work in the same way on Tree widgets as on
CList widgets. The difference is that Tree widgets can be nested
within other Tree widgets. We'll see how to do this shortly.

The Tree widget has its own window, and defaults to a white
background, as does CList. Also, most of the Tree methods work in
the same way as the corresponding CList ones. However, Tree is
not derived from CList, so you cannot use them interchangeably.


<sect1> Creating a Tree
<p>
A Tree is created in the usual way, using:

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_tree_new( void );
</verb></tscreen>

Like the CList widget, a Tree will simply keep growing as more
items are added to it, as well as when subtrees are expanded.  For
this reason, they are almost always packed into a
ScrolledWindow. You might want to use gtk_widget_set_usize() on the
scrolled window to ensure that it is big enough to see the tree's
items, as the default size for ScrolledWindow is quite small.

Now that you have a tree, you'll probably want to add some items to
it.  <ref id="sec_Tree_Item_Widget" name="The Tree Item Widget"> below
explains the gory details of TreeItem. For now, it'll suffice to
create one, using:

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_tree_item_new_with_label( gchar *label );
</verb></tscreen>

You can then add it to the tree using one of the following (see
<ref id="sec_Tree_Functions" name="Functions and Macros">
below for more options):

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_tree_append( GtkTree    *tree,
                       GtkWidget *tree_item );

void gtk_tree_prepend( GtkTree   *tree,
                       GtkWidget *tree_item );
</verb></tscreen>

Note that you must add items to a Tree one at a time - there is no
equivalent to gtk_list_*_items().

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1> Adding a Subtree
<p>
A subtree is created like any other Tree widget. A subtree is added
to another tree beneath a tree item, using:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_tree_item_set_subtree( GtkTreeItem *tree_item,
                                GtkWidget   *subtree );
</verb></tscreen>

You do not need to call gtk_widget_show() on a subtree before or after
adding it to a TreeItem. However, you <em>must</em> have added the
TreeItem in question to a parent tree before calling
gtk_tree_item_set_subtree(). This is because, technically, the parent
of the subtree is <em>not</em> the GtkTreeItem which "owns" it, but
rather the GtkTree which holds that GtkTreeItem.

When you add a subtree to a TreeItem, a plus or minus sign appears
beside it, which the user can click on to "expand" or "collapse" it,
meaning, to show or hide its subtree. TreeItems are collapsed by
default. Note that when you collapse a TreeItem, any selected
items in its subtree remain selected, which may not be what the user
expects.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1> Handling the Selection List
<p>
As with CList, the Tree type has a <tt>selection</tt> field, and
it is possible to control the behaviour of the tree (somewhat) by
setting the selection type using:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_tree_set_selection_mode( GtkTree          *tree,
                                  GtkSelectionMode  mode );
</verb></tscreen>

The semantics associated with the various selection modes are
described in the section on the CList widget. As with the CList
widget, the "select_child", "unselect_child" (not really - see <ref
id="sec_Tree_Signals" name="Signals"> below for an explanation),
and "selection_changed" signals are emitted when list items are
selected or unselected. However, in order to take advantage of these
signals, you need to know <em>which</em> Tree widget they will be
emitted by, and where to find the list of selected items.

This is a source of potential confusion. The best way to explain this
is that though all Tree widgets are created equal, some are more equal
than others. All Tree widgets have their own X window, and can
therefore receive events such as mouse clicks (if their TreeItems or
their children don't catch them first!). However, to make
<tt/GTK_SELECTION_SINGLE/ and <tt/GTK_SELECTION_BROWSE/ selection
types behave in a sane manner, the list of selected items is specific
to the topmost Tree widget in a hierarchy, known as the "root tree".

Thus, accessing the <tt>selection</tt> field directly in an arbitrary
Tree widget is not a good idea unless you <em>know</em> it's the root
tree. Instead, use the <tt/GTK_TREE_SELECTION (Tree)/ macro, which
gives the root tree's selection list as a GList pointer. Of course,
this list can include items that are not in the subtree in question if
the selection type is <tt/GTK_SELECTION_MULTIPLE/.

Finally, the "select_child" (and "unselect_child", in theory) signals
are emitted by all trees, but the "selection_changed" signal is only
emitted by the root tree. Consequently, if you want to handle the
"select_child" signal for a tree and all its subtrees, you will have
to call gtk_signal_connect() for every subtree.

<sect1> Tree Widget Internals
<p>
The Tree's struct definition looks like this:

<tscreen><verb>
struct _GtkTree
{
  GtkContainer container;

  GList *children;
  
  GtkTree* root_tree; /* owner of selection list */
  GtkWidget* tree_owner;
  GList *selection;
  guint level;
  guint indent_value;
  guint current_indent;
  guint selection_mode : 2;
  guint view_mode : 1;
  guint view_line : 1;
};
</verb></tscreen>

The perils associated with accessing the <tt>selection</tt> field
directly have already been mentioned. The other important fields of
the struct can also be accessed with handy macros or class functions.
<tt/GTK_IS_ROOT_TREE (Tree)/ returns a boolean value which
indicates whether a tree is the root tree in a Tree hierarchy, while
<tt/GTK_TREE_ROOT_TREE (Tree)/ returns the root tree, an object of
type GtkTree (so, remember to cast it using <tt/GTK_WIDGET (Tree)/ if
you want to use one of the gtk_widget_*() functions on it).

Instead of directly accessing the children field of a Tree widget,
it's probably best to cast it using >tt/GTK_CONTAINER (Tree)/, and
pass it to the gtk_container_children() function. This creates a
duplicate of the original list, so it's advisable to free it up using
g_list_free() after you're done with it, or to iterate on it
destructively, like this:

<tscreen><verb>
    children = gtk_container_children (GTK_CONTAINER (tree));
    while (children) {
      do_something_nice (GTK_TREE_ITEM (children->data));
      children = g_list_remove_link (children, children);
}
</verb></tscreen>

The <tt>tree_owner</tt> field is defined only in subtrees, where it
points to the TreeItem widget which holds the tree in question.
The <tt>level</tt> field indicates how deeply nested a particular tree
is; root trees have level 0, and each successive level of subtrees has
a level one greater than the parent level. This field is set only
after a Tree widget is actually mapped (i.e. drawn on the screen).

<sect2> Signals<label id="sec_Tree_Signals">
<p>
<tscreen><verb>
void selection_changed( GtkTree *tree );
</verb></tscreen>

This signal will be emitted whenever the <tt>selection</tt> field of a
Tree has changed. This happens when a child of the Tree is
selected or deselected.

<tscreen><verb>
void select_child( GtkTree   *tree,
                   GtkWidget *child );
</verb></tscreen>

This signal is emitted when a child of the Tree is about to get
selected. This happens on calls to gtk_tree_select_item(),
gtk_tree_select_child(), on <em>all</em> button presses and calls to
gtk_tree_item_toggle() and gtk_item_toggle().  It may sometimes be
indirectly triggered on other occasions where children get added to or
removed from the Tree.

<tscreen><verb>
void unselect_child (GtkTree   *tree,
                     GtkWidget *child);
</verb></tscreen>

This signal is emitted when a child of the Tree is about to get
deselected. As of GTK 1.0.4, this seems to only occur on calls to
gtk_tree_unselect_item() or gtk_tree_unselect_child(), and perhaps on
other occasions, but <em>not</em> when a button press deselects a
child, nor on emission of the "toggle" signal by gtk_item_toggle().

<sect2> Functions and Macros<label id="sec_Tree_Functions">
<p>

Prepend a tree item to a Tree.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_tree_insert( GtkTree   *tree,

Insert a tree item into a Tree at the position in the list
specified by <tt>position.</tt>

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_tree_remove_items( GtkTree *tree,
                            GList   *items );
</verb></tscreen>

Remove a list of items (in the form of a GList *) from a Tree.
Note that removing an item from a tree dereferences (and thus usually)
destroys it <em>and</em> its subtree, if it has one, <em>and</em> all
subtrees in that subtree. If you want to remove only one item, you
can use gtk_container_remove().

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_tree_clear_items( GtkTree *tree,
                           gint     start,
                           gint     end );
</verb></tscreen>

Remove the items from position <tt>start</tt> to position <tt>end</tt>
from a Tree. The same warning about dereferencing applies here, as
gtk_tree_clear_items() simply constructs a list and passes it to
gtk_tree_remove_items().

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_tree_select_item( GtkTree *tree,
                           gint     item );
</verb></tscreen>

Emits the "select_item" signal for the child at position
<tt>item</tt>, thus selecting the child (unless you unselect it in a
signal handler).

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_tree_unselect_item( GtkTree *tree,
                             gint     item );

Emits the "unselect_item" signal for the child at position
<tt>item</tt>, thus unselecting the child.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_tree_select_child( GtkTree   *tree,
                            GtkWidget *tree_item );
</verb></tscreen>

Emits the "select_item" signal for the child <tt>tree_item</tt>, thus
selecting it.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_tree_unselect_child( GtkTree   *tree,
                              GtkWidget *tree_item );

Emits the "unselect_item" signal for the child <tt>tree_item</tt>,
thus unselecting it.

<tscreen><verb>
gint gtk_tree_child_position( GtkTree   *tree,
                              GtkWidget *child );
</verb></tscreen>

Returns the position in the tree of <tt>child</tt>, unless
<tt>child</tt> is not in the tree, in which case it returns -1.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_tree_set_selection_mode( GtkTree          *tree,
                                  GtkSelectionMode  mode );
</verb></tscreen>

Sets the selection mode, which can be one of <tt/GTK_SELECTION_SINGLE/ (the
default), <tt/GTK_SELECTION_BROWSE/, <tt/GTK_SELECTION_MULTIPLE/, or
<tt/GTK_SELECTION_EXTENDED/. This is only defined for root trees, which
makes sense, since the root tree "owns" the selection. Setting it for
subtrees has no effect at all; the value is simply ignored.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_tree_set_view_mode( GtkTree         *tree,
                             GtkTreeViewMode  mode ); 
</verb></tscreen>

Sets the "view mode", which can be either <tt/GTK_TREE_VIEW_LINE/ (the
default) or <tt/GTK_TREE_VIEW_ITEM/.  The view mode propagates from a
tree to its subtrees, and can't be set exclusively to a subtree (this
is not exactly true - see the example code comments).

The term "view mode" is rather ambiguous - basically, it controls the
way the highlight is drawn when one of a tree's children is selected.
If it's <tt/GTK_TREE_VIEW_LINE/, the entire TreeItem widget is
highlighted, while for <tt/GTK_TREE_VIEW_ITEM/, only the child widget
(i.e., usually the label) is highlighted.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_tree_set_view_lines( GtkTree *tree,
                              guint    flag );
</verb></tscreen>

Controls whether connecting lines between tree items are drawn.
<tt>flag</tt> is either TRUE, in which case they are, or FALSE, in
which case they aren't.

<tscreen><verb>
GtkTree *GTK_TREE (gpointer obj);
</verb></tscreen>

Cast a generic pointer to "GtkTree *".

<tscreen><verb>
GtkTreeClass *GTK_TREE_CLASS (gpointer class);
</verb></tscreen>

Cast a generic pointer to "GtkTreeClass *".

<tscreen><verb>
gint GTK_IS_TREE (gpointer obj);
</verb></tscreen>

Determine if a generic pointer refers to a "GtkTree" object.

<tscreen><verb>
gint GTK_IS_ROOT_TREE (gpointer obj)
</verb></tscreen>

Determine if a generic pointer refers to a "GtkTree" object
<em>and</em> is a root tree. Though this will accept any pointer, the
results of passing it a pointer that does not refer to a Tree are
undefined and possibly harmful.

<tscreen><verb>
GtkTree *GTK_TREE_ROOT_TREE (gpointer obj)
</verb></tscreen>

Return the root tree of a pointer to a "GtkTree" object. The above
warning applies.

<tscreen><verb>
GList *GTK_TREE_SELECTION( gpointer obj)
</verb></tscreen>

Return the selection list of the root tree of a "GtkTree" object. The
above warning applies here, too.

<sect1> Tree Item Widget<label id="sec_Tree_Item_Widget">
<p>
The TreeItem widget, like CListItem, is derived from Item,
which in turn is derived from Bin.  Therefore, the item itself is a
generic container holding exactly one child widget, which can be of
any type. The TreeItem widget has a number of extra fields, but
the only one we need be concerned with is the <tt>subtree</tt> field.

The definition for the TreeItem struct looks like this:

<tscreen><verb>
struct _GtkTreeItem
{
  GtkItem item;

  GtkWidget *subtree;
  GtkWidget *pixmaps_box;
  GtkWidget *plus_pix_widget, *minus_pix_widget;

  GList *pixmaps;		/* pixmap node for this items color depth */

  guint expanded : 1;
};
</verb></tscreen>

The <tt>pixmaps_box</tt> field is an EventBox which catches clicks on
the plus/minus symbol which controls expansion and collapsing. The
<tt>pixmaps</tt> field points to an internal data structure. Since
you can always obtain the subtree of a TreeItem in a (relatively)
type-safe manner with the <tt/GTK_TREE_ITEM_SUBTREE (Item)/ macro,
it's probably advisable never to touch the insides of a TreeItem
unless you <em>really</em> know what you're doing.

Since it is directly derived from an Item it can be treated as such by
using the <tt/GTK_ITEM (TreeItem)/ macro. A TreeItem usually holds a
label, so the convenience function gtk_list_item_new_with_label() is
provided. The same effect can be achieved using code like the
following, which is actually copied verbatim from
gtk_tree_item_new_with_label():

<tscreen><verb>
tree_item = gtk_tree_item_new ();
label_widget = gtk_label_new (label);
gtk_misc_set_alignment (GTK_MISC (label_widget), 0.0, 0.5);

gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (tree_item), label_widget);
gtk_widget_show (label_widget);
</verb></tscreen>

As one is not forced to add a Label to a TreeItem, you could
also add an HBox or an Arrow, or even a Notebook (though your
app will likely be quite unpopular in this case) to the TreeItem.

If you remove all the items from a subtree, it will be destroyed and
unparented, unless you reference it beforehand, and the TreeItem
which owns it will be collapsed. So, if you want it to stick around,
do something like the following:

<tscreen><verb>
gtk_widget_ref (tree);
owner = GTK_TREE(tree)->tree_owner;
gtk_container_remove (GTK_CONTAINER(tree), item);
if (tree->parent == NULL){
  gtk_tree_item_expand (GTK_TREE_ITEM(owner));
  gtk_tree_item_set_subtree (GTK_TREE_ITEM(owner), tree);
}
else
  gtk_widget_unref (tree);
</verb></tscreen>

Finally, drag-n-drop <em>does</em> work with TreeItems. You just
have to make sure that the TreeItem you want to make into a drag
item or a drop site has not only been added to a Tree, but that
each successive parent widget has a parent itself, all the way back to
a toplevel or dialog window, when you call gtk_widget_dnd_drag_set()
or gtk_widget_dnd_drop_set().  Otherwise, strange things will happen.

<sect2> Signals
<p>
TreeItem inherits the "select", "deselect", and "toggle" signals
from Item. In addition, it adds two signals of its own, "expand"
and "collapse".

<tscreen><verb>
void select( GtkItem *tree_item );
</verb></tscreen>

This signal is emitted when an item is about to be selected, either
after it has been clicked on by the user, or when the program calls
gtk_tree_item_select(), gtk_item_select(), or gtk_tree_select_child().

<tscreen><verb>
void deselect( GtkItem *tree_item );
</verb></tscreen>

This signal is emitted when an item is about to be unselected, either
after it has been clicked on by the user, or when the program calls
gtk_tree_item_deselect() or gtk_item_deselect(). In the case of
TreeItems, it is also emitted by gtk_tree_unselect_child(), and
sometimes gtk_tree_select_child().

<tscreen><verb>
void toggle( GtkItem *tree_item );
</verb></tscreen>

This signal is emitted when the program calls gtk_item_toggle().  The
effect it has when emitted on a TreeItem is to call
gtk_tree_select_child() (and never gtk_tree_unselect_child()) on the
item's parent tree, if the item has a parent tree.  If it doesn't,
then the highlight is reversed on the item.

<tscreen><verb>
void expand( GtkTreeItem *tree_item );
</verb></tscreen>

This signal is emitted when the tree item's subtree is about to be
expanded, that is, when the user clicks on the plus sign next to the
item, or when the program calls gtk_tree_item_expand().

<tscreen><verb>
void collapse( GtkTreeItem *tree_item );
</verb></tscreen>

This signal is emitted when the tree item's subtree is about to be
collapsed, that is, when the user clicks on the minus sign next to the
item, or when the program calls gtk_tree_item_collapse().

<sect2> Functions and Macros
<p>
<tscreen><verb>
guint gtk_tree_item_get_type( void );
</verb></tscreen>

Returns the "GtkTreeItem" type identifier.

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget* gtk_tree_item_new( void );
</verb></tscreen>

Create a new TreeItem object. The new widget is returned as a
pointer to a GtkWidget object. NULL is returned on failure.

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget* gtk_tree_item_new_with_label (gchar       *label);
</verb></tscreen>

Create a new TreeItem object, having a single GtkLabel as the sole
child. The new widget is returned as a pointer to a GtkWidget
object. NULL is returned on failure.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_tree_item_select( GtkTreeItem *tree_item );
</verb></tscreen>

This function is basically a wrapper around a call to
<tt>gtk_item_select (GTK_ITEM (tree_item))</tt> which will emit the
select signal.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_tree_item_deselect( GtkTreeItem *tree_item );
</verb></tscreen>

This function is basically a wrapper around a call to
gtk_item_deselect (GTK_ITEM (tree_item)) which will emit the deselect
signal.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_tree_item_set_subtree( GtkTreeItem *tree_item,
                                GtkWidget   *subtree );
</verb></tscreen>

This function adds a subtree to tree_item, showing it if tree_item is
expanded, or hiding it if tree_item is collapsed. Again, remember that
the tree_item must have already been added to a tree for this to work.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_tree_item_remove_subtree( GtkTreeItem *tree_item );
</verb></tscreen>

This removes all of tree_item's subtree's children (thus unreferencing
and destroying it, any of its children's subtrees, and so on...), then
removes the subtree itself, and hides the plus/minus sign.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_tree_item_expand( GtkTreeItem *tree_item );
</verb></tscreen>

This emits the "expand" signal on tree_item, which expands it.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_tree_item_collapse( GtkTreeItem *tree_item );
</verb></tscreen>

This emits the "collapse" signal on tree_item, which collapses it.

<tscreen><verb>
GtkTreeItem *GTK_TREE_ITEM (gpointer obj)
</verb></tscreen>

Cast a generic pointer to "GtkTreeItem *".

<tscreen><verb>
GtkTreeItemClass *GTK_TREE_ITEM_CLASS (gpointer obj)
</verb></tscreen>

Cast a generic pointer to "GtkTreeItemClass".

<tscreen><verb>
gint GTK_IS_TREE_ITEM (gpointer obj)
</verb></tscreen>

Determine if a generic pointer refers to a "GtkTreeItem" object.
 
<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget GTK_TREE_ITEM_SUBTREE (gpointer obj)
</verb></tscreen>

Returns a tree item's subtree (<tt/obj/ should point to a
"GtkTreeItem" object).

<sect1> Tree Example
<p>
This is somewhat like the tree example in testgtk.c, but a lot less
complete (although much better commented).  It puts up a window with a
tree, and connects all the signals for the relevant objects, so you
can see when they are emitted.

<!-- ***************************************************************** -->
<sect>Menu Widget
<!-- ***************************************************************** -->
<p>
There are two ways to create menus: there's the easy way, and there's
the hard way. Both have their uses, but you can usually use the
Itemfactory (the easy way). The "hard" way is to create all the menus
using the calls directly. The easy way is to use the gtk_item_factory
calls. This is much simpler, but there are advantages and
disadvantages to each approach.

The Itemfactory is much easier to use, and to add new menus to,
although writing a few wrapper functions to create menus using the
manual method could go a long way towards usability. With the
Itemfactory, it is not possible to add images or the character '/' to
the menus.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Manual Menu Creation
<p>
In the true tradition of teaching, we'll show you the hard way
first. <tt>:)</>

There are three widgets that go into making a menubar and submenus:
<itemize>
<item>a menu item, which is what the user wants to select, e.g.,
"Save"
<item>a menu, which acts as a container for the menu items, and
<item>a menubar, which is a container for each of the individual
menus.
</itemize>

This is slightly complicated by the fact that menu item widgets are
used for two different things. They are both the widgets that are
packed into the menu, and the widget that is packed into the menubar,
which, when selected, activates the menu.

Let's look at the functions that are used to create menus and
menubars.  This first function is used to create a new menubar.

<tscreen>
<verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_menu_bar_new( void );
</verb>
</tscreen>

This rather self explanatory function creates a new menubar. You use
gtk_container_add to pack this into a window, or the box_pack
functions to pack it into a box - the same as buttons.

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_menu_new( void );
</verb></tscreen>

This function returns a pointer to a new menu; it is never actually
shown (with gtk_widget_show), it is just a container for the menu
items. I hope this will become more clear when you look at the
example below.

The next two calls are used to create menu items that are packed into
the menu (and menubar).

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_menu_item_new( void );
</verb></tscreen>

and

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_menu_item_new_with_label( const char *label );
</verb></tscreen>

These calls are used to create the menu items that are to be
displayed.  Remember to differentiate between a "menu" as created with
gtk_menu_new and a "menu item" as created by the gtk_menu_item_new
functions. The menu item will be an actual button with an associated
action, whereas a menu will be a container holding menu items.

The gtk_menu_new_with_label and gtk_menu_new functions are just as
you'd expect after reading about the buttons. One creates a new menu
item with a label already packed into it, and the other just creates a
blank menu item.

Once you've created a menu item you have to put it into a menu. This
is done using the function gtk_menu_append. In order to capture when
the item is selected by the user, we need to connect to the
<tt/activate/ signal in the usual way. So, if we wanted to create a
standard <tt/File/ menu, with the options <tt/Open/, <tt/Save/, and
<tt/Quit/, the code would look something like:

<tscreen><verb>
    file_menu = gtk_menu_new ();    /* Don't need to show menus */

    /* Create the menu items */
    open_item = gtk_menu_item_new_with_label ("Open");
    save_item = gtk_menu_item_new_with_label ("Save");
    quit_item = gtk_menu_item_new_with_label ("Quit");

    /* Add them to the menu */
    gtk_menu_append (GTK_MENU (file_menu), open_item);
    gtk_menu_append (GTK_MENU (file_menu), save_item);
    gtk_menu_append (GTK_MENU (file_menu), quit_item);

    /* Attach the callback functions to the activate signal */
    gtk_signal_connect_object (GTK_OBJECT (open_items), "activate",
                               GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (menuitem_response),
                               (gpointer) "file.open");
    gtk_signal_connect_object (GTK_OBJECT (save_items), "activate",
                               GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (menuitem_response),
                               (gpointer) "file.save");

    /* We can attach the Quit menu item to our exit function */
    gtk_signal_connect_object (GTK_OBJECT (quit_items), "activate",
                               GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (destroy),
                               (gpointer) "file.quit");

    /* We do need to show menu items */
    gtk_widget_show (open_item);
    gtk_widget_show (save_item);
    gtk_widget_show (quit_item);
</verb></tscreen>

At this point we have our menu. Now we need to create a menubar and a
menu item for the <tt/File/ entry, to which we add our menu. The code
looks like this:

<tscreen><verb>
    menu_bar = gtk_menu_bar_new ();
    gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (window), menu_bar);
    gtk_widget_show (menu_bar);

    file_item = gtk_menu_item_new_with_label ("File");
    gtk_widget_show (file_item);
</verb></tscreen>

Now we need to associate the menu with <tt/file_item/. This is done
with the function

<tscreen>
void gtk_menu_item_set_submenu( GtkMenuItem *menu_item,
                                GtkWidget   *submenu );
</tscreen>

So, our example would continue with

<tscreen><verb>
    gtk_menu_item_set_submenu (GTK_MENU_ITEM (file_item), file_menu);
</verb></tscreen>

All that is left to do is to add the menu to the menubar, which is
accomplished using the function

<tscreen>
void gtk_menu_bar_append( GtkMenuBar *menu_bar,
                          GtkWidget  *menu_item );
</tscreen>

which in our case looks like this:

<tscreen><verb>
    gtk_menu_bar_append (GTK_MENU_BAR (menu_bar), file_item);
</verb></tscreen>

If we wanted the menu right justified on the menubar, such as help
menus often are, we can use the following function (again on
<tt/file_item/ in the current example) before attaching it to the
menubar.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_menu_item_right_justify( GtkMenuItem *menu_item );
</verb></tscreen>

Here is a summary of the steps needed to create a menu bar with menus
attached:

<itemize>
<item> Create a new menu using gtk_menu_new()
<item> Use multiple calls to gtk_menu_item_new() for each item you
wish to have on your menu. And use gtk_menu_append() to put each of
these new items on to the menu.
<item> Create a menu item using gtk_menu_item_new(). This will be the
root of the menu, the text appearing here will be on the menubar
itself.
<item>Use gtk_menu_item_set_submenu() to attach the menu to the root
menu item (the one created in the above step).
<item> Create a new menubar using gtk_menu_bar_new. This step only
needs to be done once when creating a series of menus on one menu bar.
<item> Use gtk_menu_bar_append() to put the root menu onto the menubar.
</itemize>

Creating a popup menu is nearly the same. The difference is that the
menu is not posted "automatically" by a menubar, but explicitly by
calling the function gtk_menu_popup() from a button-press event, for
example.  Take these steps:

<itemize>
<item>Create an event handling function. It needs to have the
prototype
<tscreen>
static gint handler (GtkWidget *widget,
                     GdkEvent  *event);
</tscreen>
and it will use the event to find out where to pop up the menu.
<item>In the event handler, if the event is a mouse button press,
treat <tt>event</tt> as a button event (which it is) and use it as
shown in the sample code to pass information to gtk_menu_popup().
<item>Bind that event handler to a widget with
<tscreen>
    gtk_signal_connect_object (GTK_OBJECT (widget), "event",
                               GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (handler),
                               GTK_OBJECT (menu));
</tscreen>
where <tt>widget</tt> is the widget you are binding to,
<tt>handler</tt> is the handling function, and <tt>menu</tt> is a menu
created with gtk_menu_new(). This can be a menu which is also posted
by a menu bar, as shown in the sample code.
</itemize>

You may also set a menu item to be insensitive and, using an accelerator

<sect1>Using ItemFactory
<p>
Now that we've shown you the hard way, here's how you do it using the
gtk_item_factory calls.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<tscreen><verb>
/* example-start menu itemfactory.c */

#include <gtk/gtk.h>
#include <strings.h>

/* Obligatory basic callback */
static void print_hello( GtkWidget *w,

{
  g_message ("Hello, World!\n");
}

/* This is the GtkItemFactoryEntry structure used to generate new menus.
   Item 1: The menu path. The letter after the underscore indicates an
           accelerator key once the menu is open.
   Item 2: The accelerator key for the entry
   Item 3: The callback function.
   Item 4: The callback action.  This changes the parameters with
           which the function is called.  The default is 0.
   Item 5: The item type, used to define what kind of an item it is.
           Here are the possible values:

           NULL               -> "<Item>"
           ""                 -> "<Item>"

For now, there's only this example. An explanation and lots 'o' comments
will follow later.

<!-- ***************************************************************** -->
<sect> Text Widget
<!-- ***************************************************************** -->
<p>
The Text widget allows multiple lines of text to be displayed and
edited. It supports both multi-colored and multi-font text, allowing
them to be mixed in any way we wish. It also has a wide set of key
based text editing commands, which are compatible with Emacs.

The text widget supports full cut-and-paste facilities, including the
use of double- and triple-click to select a word and a whole line,
respectively.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Creating and Configuring a Text box
<p>
There is only one function for creating a new Text widget.

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_text_new( GtkAdjustment *hadj,
                         GtkAdjustment *vadj );
</verb></tscreen>

The arguments allow us to give the Text widget pointers to Adjustments
that can be used to track the viewing position of the widget. Passing
NULL values to either or both of these arguments will cause the
gtk_text_new function to create its own.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_text_set_adjustments( GtkText       *text,
                               GtkAdjustment *hadj,
                               GtkAdjustment *vadj );
</verb></tscreen>

The above function allows the horizontal and vertical adjustments of a
text widget to be changed at any time.

The text widget will not automatically create its own scrollbars when
the amount of text to be displayed is too long for the display
window. We therefore have to create and add them to the display layout
ourselves.

<tscreen><verb>
  vscrollbar = gtk_vscrollbar_new (GTK_TEXT(text)->vadj);
  gtk_box_pack_start(GTK_BOX(hbox), vscrollbar, FALSE, FALSE, 0);
  gtk_widget_show (vscrollbar);
</verb></tscreen>

The above code snippet creates a new vertical scrollbar, and attaches
it to the vertical adjustment of the text widget, <tt/text/. It then
packs it into a box in the normal way.

Note, currently the Text widget does not support horizontal
scrollbars.

There are two main ways in which a Text widget can be used: to allow
the user to edit a body of text, or to allow us to display multiple
lines of text to the user. In order for us to switch between these
modes of operation, the text widget has the following function:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_text_set_editable( GtkText *text,
                            gint     editable );
</verb></tscreen>

The <tt/editable/ argument is a TRUE or FALSE value that specifies
whether the user is permitted to edit the contents of the Text
widget. When the text widget is editable, it will display a cursor at
the current insertion point.

You are not, however, restricted to just using the text widget in
these two modes. You can toggle the editable state of the text widget
at any time, and can insert text at any time.

The text widget wraps lines of text that are too long to fit onto a
single line of the display window. Its default behaviour is to break
words across line breaks. This can be changed using the next function:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_text_set_word_wrap( GtkText *text,
                             gint     word_wrap );
</verb></tscreen>

Using this function allows us to specify that the text widget should
wrap long lines on word boundaries. The <tt/word_wrap/ argument is a
TRUE or FALSE value.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Text Manipulation
<P>
The current insertion point of a Text widget can be set using
<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_text_set_point( GtkText *text,
                         guint    index );
</verb></tscreen>

where <tt/index/ is the position to set the insertion point.

Analogous to this is the function for getting the current insertion
point:

<tscreen><verb>
guint gtk_text_get_point( GtkText *text );
</verb></tscreen>

A function that is useful in combination with the above two functions
is

<tscreen><verb>
guint gtk_text_get_length( GtkText *text );
</verb></tscreen>

which returns the current length of the Text widget. The length is the
number of characters that are within the text block of the widget,
including characters such as newline, which marks the end of
lines.

In order to insert text at the current insertion point of a Text
widget, the function gtk_text_insert is used, which also allows us to
specify background and foreground colors and a font for the text.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_text_insert( GtkText    *text,
                      GdkFont    *font,
                      GdkColor   *fore,
                      GdkColor   *back,
                      const char *chars,
                      gint        length );
</verb></tscreen>

Passing a value of <tt/NULL/ in as the value for the foreground color,
background color or font will result in the values set within the
widget style to be used. Using a value of <tt/-1/ for the length
parameter will result in the whole of the text string given being
inserted.

The text widget is one of the few within GTK that redraws itself
dynamically, outside of the gtk_main function. This means that all
changes to the contents of the text widget take effect
immediately. This may be undesirable when performing multiple changes
to the text widget. In order to allow us to perform multiple updates
to the text widget without it continuously redrawing, we can freeze
the widget, which temporarily stops it from automatically redrawing
itself every time it is changed. We can then thaw the widget after our
updates are complete.

The following two functions perform this freeze and thaw action:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_text_freeze( GtkText *text );

void gtk_text_thaw( GtkText *text );         
</verb></tscreen>

Text is deleted from the text widget relative to the current insertion
point by the following two functions. The return value is a TRUE or
FALSE indicator of whether the operation was successful.

<tscreen><verb>
gint gtk_text_backward_delete( GtkText *text,
                               guint    nchars );

gint gtk_text_forward_delete ( GtkText *text,
                               guint    nchars );
</verb></tscreen>

If you want to retrieve the contents of the text widget, then the
macro <tt/GTK_TEXT_INDEX(t, index)/ allows you to retrieve the
character at position <tt/index/ within the text widget <tt/t/.

To retrieve larger blocks of text, we can use the function

<tscreen><verb>
gchar *gtk_editable_get_chars( GtkEditable *editable,
                               gint         start_pos,
                               gint         end_pos );   
</verb></tscreen>

This is a function of the parent class of the text widget. A value of
-1 as <tt/end_pos/ signifies the end of the text. The index of the
text starts at 0.

The function allocates a new chunk of memory for the text block, so
don't forget to free it with a call to g_free when you have finished
with it.
 
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Keyboard Shortcuts
<p>
The text widget has a number of pre-installed keyboard shortcuts for
common editing, motion and selection functions. These are accessed
using Control and Alt key combinations.

In addition to these, holding down the Control key whilst using cursor
key movement will move the cursor by words rather than
characters. Holding down Shift whilst using cursor movement will
extend the selection.

If you must use one of these widgets that are undocumented, I strongly
suggest you take a look at their respective header files in the GTK
distribution. GTK's function names are very descriptive. Once you
have an understanding of how things work, it's not difficult to figure
out how to use a widget simply by looking at its function
declarations. This, along with a few examples from others' code, and
it should be no problem.

When you do come to understand all the functions of a new undocumented
widget, please consider writing a tutorial on it so others may benefit

Previews serve a number of purposes in GIMP/GTK. The most important one is
this. High quality images may take up to tens of megabytes of memory - easily!
Any operation on an image that big is bound to take a long time. If it takes
you 5-10 trial-and-errors (i.e., 10-20 steps, since you have to revert after
you make an error) to choose the desired modification, it make take you
literally hours to make the right one - if you don't run out of memory
first. People who have spent hours in color darkrooms know the feeling.
Previews to the rescue!

But the annoyance of the delay is not the only issue. Oftentimes it is
helpful to compare the Before and After versions side-by-side or at least
back-to-back. If you're working with big images and 10 second delays,
obtaining the Before and After impressions is, to say the least, difficult.
For 30M images (4"x6", 600dpi, 24 bit) the side-by-side comparison is right
out for most people, while back-to-back is more like back-to-1001, 1002,
..., 1010-back! Previews to the rescue!

But there's more. Previews allow for side-by-side pre-previews. In other
words, you write a plug-in (e.g., the filterpack simulation) which would have
a number of here's-what-it-would-look-like-if-you-were-to-do-this previews.
An approach like this acts as a sort of a preview palette and is very
effective for subtle changes. Let's go previews!

There's more. For certain plug-ins real-time image-specific human
intervention maybe necessary. In the SuperNova plug-in, for example, the
user is asked to enter the coordinates of the center of the future
supernova. The easiest way to do this, really, is to present the user with a
preview and ask him to interactively select the spot. Let's go previews!

Finally, a couple of misc uses. One can use previews even when not working
with big images. For example, they are useful when rendering complicated
patterns. (Just check out the venerable Diffraction plug-in + many other
ones!) As another example, take a look at the colormap rotation plug-in
(work in progress). You can also use previews for little logos inside you
plug-ins and even for an image of yourself, The Author. Let's go previews!

When Not to Use Previews

Don't use previews for graphs, drawing, etc. GDK is much faster for that. Use
previews only for rendered images!

Let's go previews!

You can stick a preview into just about anything. In a vbox, an hbox, a
table, a button, etc. But they look their best in tight frames around them.
Previews by themselves do not have borders and look flat without them. (Of
course, if the flat look is what you want...) Tight frames provide the
necessary borders.

                               [Image][Image]

Previews in many ways are like any other widgets in GTK (whatever that
means) except they possess an additional feature: they need to be filled with
some sort of an image! First, we will deal exclusively with the GTK aspect
of previews and then we'll discuss how to fill them.

GtkWidget *preview!

Without any ado:

                              /* Create a preview widget,
                              set its size, an show it */
GtkWidget *preview;
preview=gtk_preview_new(GTK_PREVIEW_COLOR)
                              /*Other option:
                              GTK_PREVIEW_GRAYSCALE);*/
gtk_preview_size (GTK_PREVIEW (preview), WIDTH, HEIGHT);
gtk_widget_show(preview);
my_preview_rendering_function(preview);

Oh yeah, like I said, previews look good inside frames, so how about:

GtkWidget *create_a_preview(int        Width,
                            int        Height,
                            int        Colorfulness)
{
  GtkWidget *preview;
  GtkWidget *frame;
  
  frame = gtk_frame_new(NULL);
  gtk_frame_set_shadow_type (GTK_FRAME (frame), GTK_SHADOW_IN);
  gtk_container_set_border_width (GTK_CONTAINER(frame),0);
  gtk_widget_show(frame);

  preview=gtk_preview_new (Colorfulness?GTK_PREVIEW_COLOR
                                       :GTK_PREVIEW_GRAYSCALE);
  gtk_preview_size (GTK_PREVIEW (preview), Width, Height);
  gtk_container_add(GTK_CONTAINER(frame),preview);
  gtk_widget_show(preview);

  my_preview_rendering_function(preview);
  return frame;
}

That's my basic preview. This routine returns the "parent" frame so you can
place it somewhere else in your interface. Of course, you can pass the
parent frame to this routine as a parameter. In many situations, however,
the contents of the preview are changed continually by your application. In
this case you may want to pass a pointer to the preview to a
"create_a_preview()" and thus have control of it later.

One more important note that may one day save you a lot of time. Sometimes
it is desirable to label you preview. For example, you may label the preview
containing the original image as "Original" and the one containing the
modified image as "Less Original". It might occur to you to pack the
preview along with the appropriate label into a vbox. The unexpected caveat
is that if the label is wider than the preview (which may happen for a
variety of reasons unforseeable to you, from the dynamic decision on the
size of the preview to the size of the font) the frame expands and no longer
fits tightly over the preview. The same problem can probably arise in other
situations as well.

                                   [Image]

The solution is to place the preview and the label into a 2x1 table and by
attaching them with the following parameters (this is one possible variations
of course. The key is no GTK_FILL in the second attachment):

gtk_table_attach(GTK_TABLE(table),label,0,1,0,1,
                 0,
                 GTK_EXPAND|GTK_FILL,
                 0,0);
gtk_table_attach(GTK_TABLE(table),frame,0,1,1,2,
                 GTK_EXPAND,
                 GTK_EXPAND,
                 0,0);


And here's the result:

                                   [Image]

Misc

Making a preview clickable is achieved most easily by placing it in a
button. It also adds a nice border around the preview and you may not even
need to place it in a frame. See the Filter Pack Simulation plug-in for an
example.

This is pretty much it as far as GTK is concerned.

Filling In a Preview

In order to familiarize ourselves with the basics of filling in previews,
let's create the following pattern (contrived by trial and error):

                                   [Image]

void
my_preview_rendering_function(GtkWidget     *preview)
{
#define SIZE 100
#define HALF (SIZE/2)

  guchar *row=(guchar *) malloc(3*SIZE); /* 3 bits per dot */
  gint i, j;                             /* Coordinates    */
  double r, alpha, x, y;

  if (preview==NULL) return; /* I usually add this when I want */
                             /* to avoid silly crashes. You    */
                             /* should probably make sure that */
                             /* everything has been nicely     */
                             /* initialized!                   */
  for (j=0; j < ABS(cos(2*alpha)) ) { /* Are we inside the shape?  */
                                         /* glib.h contains ABS(x).   */
        row[i*3+0] = sqrt(1-r)*255;      /* Define Red                */
        row[i*3+1] = 128;                /* Define Green              */
        row[i*3+2] = 224;                /* Define Blue               */
      }                                  /* "+0" is for alignment!    */
      else {
        row[i*3+0] = r*255;
        row[i*3+1] = ABS(sin((float)i/SIZE*2*PI))*255;
        row[i*3+2] = ABS(sin((float)j/SIZE*2*PI))*255;
      }
    }
    gtk_preview_draw_row( GTK_PREVIEW(preview),row,0,j,SIZE);
    /* Insert "row" into "preview" starting at the point with  */
    /* coordinates (0,j) first column, j_th row extending SIZE */
    /* pixels to the right */
  }

  free(row); /* save some space */
  gtk_widget_draw(preview,NULL); /* what does this do? */
  gdk_flush(); /* or this? */
}

Non-GIMP users can have probably seen enough to do a lot of things already.
For the GIMP users I have a few pointers to add.

Image Preview

It is probably wise to keep a reduced version of the image around with just
enough pixels to fill the preview. This is done by selecting every n'th
pixel where n is the ratio of the size of the image to the size of the
preview. All further operations (including filling in the previews) are then
performed on the reduced number of pixels only. The following is my
implementation of reducing the image. (Keep in mind that I've had only basic
C!)

(UNTESTED CODE ALERT!!!)

typedef struct {
  gint      width;
  gint      height;
  gint      bbp;
  guchar    *rgb;
  guchar    *mask;
} ReducedImage;

enum {
  SELECTION_ONLY,
  SELECTION_IN_CONTEXT,
  ENTIRE_IMAGE

The following is a preview function which used the same ReducedImage type!
Note that it uses fakes transparency (if one is present by means of
fake_transparency which is defined as follows:

gint fake_transparency(gint i, gint j)

<sect>Timeouts, IO and Idle Functions<label id="sec_timeouts">
<!-- ***************************************************************** -->

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Timeouts
<p>
You may be wondering how you make GTK do useful work when in gtk_main.
Well, you have several options. Using the following function you can
create a timeout function that will be called every "interval"
milliseconds.

<tscreen><verb>
gint gtk_timeout_add( guint32     interval,
                      GtkFunction function,
                      gpointer    data );
</verb></tscreen>

The first argument is the number of milliseconds between calls to your
function. The second argument is the function you wish to have called,
and the third, the data passed to this callback function. The return
value is an integer "tag" which may be used to stop the timeout by
calling:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_timeout_remove( gint tag );
</verb></tscreen>

You may also stop the timeout function by returning zero or FALSE from
your callback function. Obviously this means if you want your function
to continue to be called, it should return a non-zero value,
i.e., TRUE.

The declaration of your callback should look something like this:

<tscreen><verb>
gint timeout_callback( gpointer data );
</verb></tscreen>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Monitoring IO
<p>
A nifty feature of GDK (the library that underlies GTK), is the
ability to have it check for data on a file descriptor for you (as
returned by open(2) or socket(2)). This is especially useful for
networking applications. The function:

<tscreen><verb>
gint gdk_input_add( gint              source,
                    GdkInputCondition condition,
                    GdkInputFunction  function,
                    gpointer          data );
</verb></tscreen>

Where the first argument is the file descriptor you wish to have
watched, and the second specifies what you want GDK to look for. This
may be one of:

<itemize>
<item><tt/GDK_INPUT_READ/ - Call your function when there is data
ready for reading on your file descriptor.

<item>><tt/GDK_INPUT_WRITE/ - Call your function when the file
descriptor is ready for writing.
</itemize>

As I'm sure you've figured out already, the third argument is the
function you wish to have called when the above conditions are
satisfied, and the fourth is the data to pass to this function.

The return value is a tag that may be used to stop GDK from monitoring
this file descriptor using the following function.

<tscreen><verb>
void gdk_input_remove( gint tag );
</verb></tscreen>

The callback function should be declared as:

<tscreen><verb>
void input_callback( gpointer          data,
                     gint              source, 
                     GdkInputCondition condition );
</verb></tscreen>

Where <tt/source/ and <tt/condition/ are as specified above.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Idle Functions
<p>
<!-- TODO: Need to check on idle priorities - TRG -->
What if you have a function which you want to be called when nothing
else is happening ?

<tscreen><verb>
gint gtk_idle_add( GtkFunction function,
                   gpointer    data );
</verb></tscreen>

This causes GTK to call the specified function whenever nothing else
is happening.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_idle_remove( gint tag );
</verb></tscreen>

I won't explain the meaning of the arguments as they follow very much
like the ones above. The function pointed to by the first argument to
gtk_idle_add will be called whenever the opportunity arises. As with
the others, returning FALSE will stop the idle function from being
called.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Signal Emission and Propagation
<p>
Signal emission is the process whereby GTK runs all handlers for a
specific object and signal.

First, note that the return value from a signal emission is the return
value of the <em>last</em> handler executed. Since event signals are
all of type <tt/GTK_RUN_LAST/, this will be the default (GTK supplied)
handler, unless you connect with gtk_signal_connect_after().

The way an event (say "button_press_event") is handled, is:
<itemize>
<item>Start with the widget where the event occured.

<item>Emit the generic "event" signal. If that signal handler returns
a value of TRUE, stop all processing.

<item>Otherwise, emit a specific, "button_press_event" signal. If that
returns TRUE, stop all processing.

<item>Otherwise, go to the widget's parent, and repeat the above two
steps.

<item>Continue until some signal handler returns TRUE, or until the
top-level widget is reached.
</itemize>

Some consequences of the above are:
<itemize>
<item>Your handler's return value will have no effect if there is a
default handler, unless you connect with gtk_signal_connect_after().

<item>To prevent the default handler from being run, you need to
connect with gtk_signal_connect() and use
gtk_signal_emit_stop_by_name() - the return value only affects whether
the signal is propagated, not the current emission.
</itemize>

<!-- ***************************************************************** -->
<sect>Managing Selections
<!-- ***************************************************************** -->

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1> Overview
<p>
One type of interprocess communication supported by X and GTK is
<em>selections</em>. A selection identifies a chunk of data, for
instance, a portion of text, selected by the user in some fashion, for
instance, by dragging with the mouse. Only one application on a
display (the <em>owner</em>) can own a particular selection at one
time, so when a selection is claimed by one application, the previous
owner must indicate to the user that selection has been
relinquished. Other applications can request the contents of a
selection in different forms, called <em>targets</em>. There can be
any number of selections, but most X applications only handle one, the
<em>primary selection</em>.

In most cases, it isn't necessary for a GTK application to deal with
selections itself. The standard widgets, such as the Entry widget,
already have the capability to claim the selection when appropriate
(e.g., when the user drags over text), and to retrieve the contents of
the selection owned by another widget or another application (e.g.,
when the user clicks the second mouse button). However, there may be
cases in which you want to give other widgets the ability to supply
the selection, or you wish to retrieve targets not supported by
default.

A fundamental concept needed to understand selection handling is that
of the <em>atom</em>. An atom is an integer that uniquely identifies a
string (on a certain display). Certain atoms are predefined by the X
server, and in some cases there are constants in <tt>gtk.h</tt>
corresponding to these atoms. For instance the constant
<tt>GDK_PRIMARY_SELECTION</tt> corresponds to the string "PRIMARY".
In other cases, you should use the functions
<tt>gdk_atom_intern()</tt>, to get the atom corresponding to a string,
and <tt>gdk_atom_name()</tt>, to get the name of an atom. Both
selections and targets are identified by atoms.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1> Retrieving the selection
<p>
Retrieving the selection is an asynchronous process. To start the
process, you call:

<tscreen><verb>
gint gtk_selection_convert( GtkWidget *widget, 
                            GdkAtom    selection, 
                            GdkAtom    target,
                            guint32    time );
</verb</tscreen>

This <em>converts</em> the selection into the form specified by
<tt/target/. If at all possible, the time field should be the time
from the event that triggered the selection. This helps make sure that
events occur in the order that the user requested them. However, if it
is not available (for instance, if the conversion was triggered by a
"clicked" signal), then you can use the constant
<tt>GDK_CURRENT_TIME</tt>.

When the selection owner responds to the request, a
"selection_received" signal is sent to your application. The handler
for this signal receives a pointer to a <tt>GtkSelectionData</tt>
structure, which is defined as:

<tscreen><verb>
struct _GtkSelectionData
{
  GdkAtom selection;
  GdkAtom target;
  GdkAtom type;
  gint    format;
  guchar *data;
  gint    length;
};
</verb></tscreen>

<tt>selection</tt> and <tt>target</tt> are the values you gave in your
<tt>gtk_selection_convert()</tt> call. <tt>type</tt> is an atom that
identifies the type of data returned by the selection owner. Some
possible values are "STRING", a string of latin-1 characters, "ATOM",
a series of atoms, "INTEGER", an integer, etc. Most targets can only
return one type. <tt/format/ gives the length of the units (for
instance characters) in bits. Usually, you don't care about this when
receiving data. <tt>data</tt> is a pointer to the returned data, and
<tt>length</tt> gives the length of the returned data, in bytes. If
<tt>length</tt> is negative, then an error occurred and the selection
could not be retrieved. This might happen if no application owned the
selection, or if you requested a target that the application didn't
support. The buffer is actually guaranteed to be one byte longer than
<tt>length</tt>; the extra byte will always be zero, so it isn't
necessary to make a copy of strings just to null terminate them.

In the following example, we retrieve the special target "TARGETS",
which is a list of all targets into which the selection can be
converted.

<tscreen><verb>
/* example-start selection gettargets.c */

#include <gtk/gtk.h>

void selection_received( GtkWidget        *widget, 
                         GtkSelectionData *selection_data, 
                         gpointer          data );

/* Signal handler invoked when user clicks on the "Get Targets" button */
void get_targets( GtkWidget *widget,
                  gpointer data )
{
  static GdkAtom targets_atom = GDK_NONE;

  /* Get the atom corresponding to the string "TARGETS" */
  if (targets_atom == GDK_NONE)
    targets_atom = gdk_atom_intern ("TARGETS", FALSE);

  /* And request the "TARGETS" target for the primary selection */
  gtk_selection_convert (widget, GDK_SELECTION_PRIMARY, targets_atom,
			 GDK_CURRENT_TIME);
}

/* Signal handler called when the selections owner returns the data */
void selection_received( GtkWidget        *widget,
                         GtkSelectionData *selection_data, 
		         gpointer          data )
{
  GdkAtom *atoms;
  GList *item_list;
  int i;

  /* **** IMPORTANT **** Check to see if retrieval succeeded  */
  if (selection_data->length < 0)
    {
      g_print ("Selection retrieval failed\n");
      return;
    }
  /* Make sure we got the data in the expected form */
  if (selection_data->type != GDK_SELECTION_TYPE_ATOM)
    {
      g_print ("Selection \"TARGETS\" was not returned as atoms!\n");
      return;
    }
  
  /* Print out the atoms we received */
  atoms = (GdkAtom *)selection_data->data;

  item_list = NULL;
  for (i=0; i<selection_data->length/sizeof(GdkAtom); i++)
    {
      char *name;
      name = gdk_atom_name (atoms[i]);
      if (name != NULL)
	g_print ("%s\n",name);
      else
	g_print ("(bad atom)\n");
    }

  return;
}

int main( int   argc,
          char *argv[] )
{
  GtkWidget *window;
  GtkWidget *button;
  
  gtk_init (&amp;argc, &amp;argv);

  /* Create the toplevel window */

  window = gtk_window_new (GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);

  button = gtk_button_new_with_label ("Get Targets");

  return 0;
}
/* example-end */

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1> Supplying the selection 
<p>
Supplying the selection is a bit more complicated. You must register 
handlers that will be called when your selection is requested. For
each selection/target pair you will handle, you make a call to:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_selection_add_target (GtkWidget           *widget, 
                               GdkAtom              selection,
                               GdkAtom              target,
                               guint                info);
</verb></tscreen>

<tt/widget/, <tt/selection/, and <tt/target/ identify the requests
this handler will manage. When a request for a selection is received,
the "selection_get" signal will be called. <tt/info/ can be used as an
enumerator to identify the specific target within the callback function.

The callback function has the signature:

<tscreen><verb>
void  "selection_get" (GtkWidget          *widget,
                       GtkSelectionData   *selection_data,
                       guint               info,
                       guint               time);
</verb></tscreen>

The GtkSelectionData is the same as above, but this time, we're
responsible for filling in the fields <tt/type/, <tt/format/,
<tt/data/, and <tt/length/. (The <tt/format/ field is actually
important here - the X server uses it to figure out whether the data
needs to be byte-swapped or not. Usually it will be 8 - <em/i.e./ a
character - or 32 - <em/i.e./ a. integer.) This is done by calling the
function:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_selection_data_set( GtkSelectionData *selection_data,
                             GdkAtom           type,
                             gint              format,
                             guchar           *data,
                             gint              length );
</verb></tscreen>

This function takes care of properly making a copy of the data so that
you don't have to worry about keeping it around. (You should not fill
in the fields of the GtkSelectionData structure by hand.)

When prompted by the user, you claim ownership of the selection by
calling:

<tscreen><verb>
gint gtk_selection_owner_set( GtkWidget *widget,
                              GdkAtom    selection,
                              guint32    time );
</verb></tscreen>

If another application claims ownership of the selection, you will
receive a "selection_clear_event".

As an example of supplying the selection, the following program adds
selection functionality to a toggle button. When the toggle button is
depressed, the program claims the primary selection. The only target
supported (aside from certain targets like "TARGETS" supplied by GTK
itself), is the "STRING" target. When this target is requested, a
string representation of the time is returned.

<tscreen><verb>
/* example-start selection setselection.c */

#include <gtk/gtk.h>
#include <time.h>

/* Callback when the user toggles the selection */
void selection_toggled( GtkWidget *widget,
                        gint      *have_selection )
{
  if (GTK_TOGGLE_BUTTON(widget)->active)
    {
      *have_selection = gtk_selection_owner_set (widget,
						 GDK_SELECTION_PRIMARY,
						 GDK_CURRENT_TIME);
      /* if claiming the selection failed, we return the button to
	 the out state */
      if (!*have_selection)
	gtk_toggle_button_set_active (GTK_TOGGLE_BUTTON(widget), FALSE);
    }
  else
    {
      if (*have_selection)
	{
	  /* Before clearing the selection by setting the owner to NULL,
	     we check if we are the actual owner */
	  if (gdk_selection_owner_get (GDK_SELECTION_PRIMARY) == widget->window)
	    gtk_selection_owner_set (NULL, GDK_SELECTION_PRIMARY,
				     GDK_CURRENT_TIME);
	  *have_selection = FALSE;
	}
    }
}

/* Called when another application claims the selection */
gint selection_clear( GtkWidget         *widget,
                      GdkEventSelection *event,
                      gint              *have_selection )
{
  *have_selection = FALSE;
  gtk_toggle_button_set_active (GTK_TOGGLE_BUTTON(widget), FALSE);

  return TRUE;
}

/* Supplies the current time as the selection. */

<!-- ***************************************************************** -->
<p>
GLib is a lower-level library that provides many useful definitions
and functions available for use when creating GDK and GTK
applications. These include definitions for basic types and their
limits, standard macros, type conversions, byte order, memory
allocation, warnings and assertions, message logging, timers, string
utilities, hook functions, a lexical scanner, dynamic loading of
modules, and automatic string completion. A number of data structures
(and their related operations) are also defined, including memory
chunks, doubly-linked lists, singly-linked lists, hash tables, strings
(which can grow dynamically), string chunks (groups of strings),
arrays (which can grow in size as elements are added), balanced binary
trees, N-ary trees, quarks (a two-way association of a string and a
unique integer identifier), keyed data lists (lists of data elements
accessible by a string or integer id), relations and tuples (tables of
data which can be indexed on any number of fields), and caches.

A summary of some of GLib's capabilities follows; not every function,
data structure, or operation is covered here.  For more complete
information about the GLib routines, see the GLib documentation. One
source of GLib documentation is <htmlurl url="http://www.gtk.org/"
name="http://www.gtk.org/">.

If you are using a language other than C, you should consult your
language's binding documentation. In some cases your language may
have equivalent functionality built-in, while in other cases it may
not.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Definitions
<p>
Definitions for the extremes of many of the standard types are:

G_MAXFLOAT
G_MINDOUBLE
G_MAXDOUBLE
G_MINSHORT
G_MAXSHORT
G_MININT
G_MAXINT
G_MINLONG
G_MAXLONG
</verb></tscreen>

Also, the following typedefs. The ones left unspecified are dynamically set
depending on the architecture. Remember to avoid counting on the size of a
pointer if you want to be portable! E.g., a pointer on an Alpha is 8
bytes, but 4 on Intel 80x86 family CPUs.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Doubly Linked Lists
<p>
The following functions are used to create, manage, and destroy
standard doubly linked lists. Each element in the list contains a
piece of data, together with pointers which link to the previous and
next elements in the list. This enables easy movement in either
direction through the list. The data item is of type "gpointer",
which means the data can be a pointer to your real data or (through
casting) a numeric value (but do not assume that int and gpointer have
the same size!). These routines internally allocate list elements in
blocks, which is more efficient than allocating elements individually.

There is no function to specifically create a list. Instead, simply
create a variable of type GList* and set its value to NULL; NULL is
considered to be the empty list.

To add elements to a list, use the g_list_append(), g_list_prepend(),
g_list_insert(), or g_list_insert_sorted() routines. In all cases
they accept a pointer to the beginning of the list, and return the
(possibly changed) pointer to the beginning of the list. Thus, for
all of the operations that add or remove elements, be sure to save the
returned value!

<tscreen><verb>
GList *g_list_append( GList    *list,
                      gpointer  data );
</verb></tscreen>

This adds a new element (with value <tt/data/) onto the end of the
list.
  
<tscreen><verb>	   
GList *g_list_prepend( GList    *list,
                       gpointer  data );
</verb></tscreen>

This adds a new element (with value <tt/data/) to the beginning of the
list.

<tscreen><verb>		
GList *g_list_insert( GList    *list,
                      gpointer  data,
                      gint      position );

</verb></tscreen>

This inserts a new element (with value data) into the list at the
given position. If position is 0, this is just like g_list_prepend();
if position is less than 0, this is just like g_list_append().

<tscreen><verb>
GList *g_list_remove( GList    *list,
                      gpointer  data );
</verb></tscreen>

This removes the element in the list with the value <tt/data/;
if the element isn't there, the list is unchanged.

<tscreen><verb>
void g_list_free( GList *list );
</verb></tscreen>

This frees all of the memory used by a GList. If the list elements
refer to dynamically-allocated memory, then they should be freed
first.

There are many other GLib functions that support doubly linked lists;
see the glib documentation for more information.  Here are a few of
the more useful functions' signatures:

<tscreen><verb>		   
GList *g_list_remove_link( GList *list,
                           GList *link );

GList *g_list_reverse( GList *list );

GList *g_list_nth( GList *list,
                   gint   n );
			   
GList *g_list_find( GList    *list,
                    gpointer  data );

GList *g_list_last( GList *list );

GList *g_list_first( GList *list );

gint g_list_length( GList *list );

void g_list_foreach( GList    *list,
                     GFunc     func,
                     gpointer  user_data );
</verb></tscreen>					      

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Singly Linked Lists
<p>
Many of the above functions for singly linked lists are identical to the
above. Here is a list of some of their operations:

<tscreen><verb>
GSList *g_slist_append( GSList   *list,
                        gpointer  data );
		
GSList *g_slist_prepend( GSList   *list,
                         gpointer  data );
			     
GSList *g_slist_insert( GSList   *list,
                        gpointer  data,
		        gint      position );
			     
GSList *g_slist_remove( GSList   *list,
                        gpointer  data );
			     
GSList *g_slist_remove_link( GSList *list,
                             GSList *link );
			     
GSList *g_slist_reverse( GSList *list );

GSList *g_slist_nth( GSList *list,
                     gint    n );
			     
GSList *g_slist_find( GSList   *list,
                      gpointer  data );
			     
GSList *g_slist_last( GSList *list );

gint g_slist_length( GSList *list );

void g_slist_foreach( GSList   *list,
                      GFunc     func,
                      gpointer  user_data );
	
</verb></tscreen>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Memory Management
<p>
<tscreen><verb>
gpointer g_malloc( gulong size );
</verb></tscreen>

This is a replacement for malloc(). You do not need to check the return
value as it is done for you in this function. If the memory allocation
fails for whatever reasons, your applications will be terminated.

<tscreen><verb>
gpointer g_malloc0( gulong size );
</verb></tscreen>

Same as above, but zeroes the memory before returning a pointer to it.

<tscreen><verb>
gpointer g_realloc( gpointer mem,
                    gulong   size );
</verb></tscreen>

Relocates "size" bytes of memory starting at "mem".  Obviously, the
memory should have been previously allocated.

<tscreen><verb>
void g_free( gpointer mem );
</verb></tscreen>

Frees memory. Easy one. If <tt/mem/ is NULL it simply returns.

<tscreen><verb>
void g_mem_profile( void );
</verb></tscreen>

Dumps a profile of used memory, but requires that you add <tt>#define
MEM_PROFILE</tt> to the top of glib/gmem.c and re-make and make install.

<tscreen><verb>
void g_mem_check( gpointer mem );
</verb></tscreen>

Checks that a memory location is valid. Requires you add <tt>#define
MEM_CHECK</tt> to the top of gmem.c and re-make and make install.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Timers
<p>
Timer functions can be used to time operations (e.g., to see how much
time has elapsed). First, you create a new timer with g_timer_new().
You can then use g_timer_start() to start timing an operation,
g_timer_stop() to stop timing an operation, and g_timer_elapsed() to
determine the elapsed time.

<tscreen><verb>
GTimer *g_timer_new( void );

void g_timer_destroy( GTimer *timer );

void g_timer_start( GTimer  *timer );

void g_timer_stop( GTimer  *timer );

void g_timer_reset( GTimer  *timer );

gdouble g_timer_elapsed( GTimer *timer,
                         gulong *microseconds );
</verb></tscreen>			 

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>String Handling
<p>
GLib defines a new type called a GString, which is similar to a
standard C string but one that grows automatically. Its string data
is null-terminated. What this gives you is protection from buffer
overflow programming errors within your program. This is a very
important feature, and hence I recommend that you make use of
GStrings. GString itself has a simple public definition:

<tscreen><verb>
struct GString 
{
  gchar *str; /* Points to the string's current \0-terminated value. */
  gint len; /* Current length */
};
</verb></tscreen>

As you might expect, there are a number of operations you can do with
a GString.

<tscreen><verb>
GString *g_string_new( gchar *init );
</verb></tscreen>

This constructs a GString, copying the string value of <tt/init/
into the GString and returning a pointer to it. NULL may be given as
the argument for an initially empty GString.
 
<tscreen><verb>

void g_string_free( GString *string,
                    gint     free_segment );
</verb></tscreen>

This frees the memory for the given GString. If <tt/free_segment/ is
TRUE, then this also frees its character data.

<tscreen><verb>
			     
GString *g_string_assign( GString     *lval,
                          const gchar *rval );
</verb></tscreen>

This copies the characters from rval into lval, destroying the
previous contents of lval. Note that lval will be lengthened as
necessary to hold the string's contents, unlike the standard strcpy()
function.

The rest of these functions should be relatively obvious (the _c
versions accept a character instead of a string):

<tscreen><verb>		     
GString *g_string_truncate( GString *string,
                            gint     len );
			     
GString *g_string_append( GString *string,
                          gchar   *val );
			    
GString *g_string_append_c( GString *string,
                            gchar    c );
	
GString *g_string_prepend( GString *string,
                           gchar   *val );
			     
GString *g_string_prepend_c( GString *string,
                             gchar    c );
	
void g_string_sprintf( GString *string,
                       gchar   *fmt,
                       ...);
	
void g_string_sprintfa ( GString *string,
                         gchar   *fmt,
                         ... );
</verb></tscreen>							  

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Utility and Error Functions
<p>
<tscreen><verb>
gchar *g_strdup( const gchar *str );
</verb></tscreen>

Replacement strdup function.  Copies the original strings contents to
newly allocated memory, and returns a pointer to it.

<tscreen><verb>
gchar *g_strerror( gint errnum );
</verb></tscreen>

I recommend using this for all error messages.  It's much nicer, and more
portable than perror() or others.  The output is usually of the form:

<tscreen><verb>
program name:function that failed:file or further description:strerror
</verb></tscreen>

Here's an example of one such call used in our hello_world program:

<tscreen><verb>
g_print("hello_world:open:%s:%s\n", filename, g_strerror(errno));
</verb></tscreen>

<tscreen><verb>
void g_error( gchar *format, ... );
</verb></tscreen>

Prints an error message. The format is just like printf, but it
prepends "** ERROR **: " to your message, and exits the program.  
Use only for fatal errors.

<tscreen><verb>
void g_warning( gchar *format, ... );
</verb></tscreen>

Same as above, but prepends "** WARNING **: ", and does not exit the
program.

<tscreen><verb>
void g_message( gchar *format, ... );
</verb></tscreen>

Prints "message: " prepended to the string you pass in.

<tscreen><verb>
void g_print( gchar *format, ... );
</verb></tscreen>

Replacement for printf().

And our last function:

<tscreen><verb>
gchar *g_strsignal( gint signum );
</verb></tscreen>

Prints out the name of the Unix system signal given the signal number.
Useful in generic signal handling functions.

All of the above are more or less just stolen from glib.h.  If anyone cares
to document any function, just send me an email!

<!-- ***************************************************************** -->
<sect>GTK's rc Files <label id="sec_gtkrc_files">
<!-- ***************************************************************** -->
<p>
GTK has its own way of dealing with application defaults, by using rc
files. These can be used to set the colors of just about any widget, and
can also be used to tile pixmaps onto the background of some widgets.  

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>Functions For rc Files 
<p>
When your application starts, you should include a call to:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_rc_parse( char *filename );
</verb></tscreen>

Passing in the filename of your rc file. This will cause GTK to parse
this file, and use the style settings for the widget types defined
there.

If you wish to have a special set of widgets that can take on a
different style from others, or any other logical division of widgets,
use a call to:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_widget_set_name( GtkWidget *widget,
                          gchar     *name );
</verb></tscreen>

Passing your newly created widget as the first argument, and the name
you wish to give it as the second. This will allow you to change the
attributes of this widget by name through the rc file.

If we use a call something like this:

<tscreen><verb>
button = gtk_button_new_with_label ("Special Button");
gtk_widget_set_name (button, "special button");
</verb></tscreen>

Then this button is given the name "special button" and may be addressed by
name in the rc file as "special button.GtkButton".  [<--- Verify ME!]

The example rc file below, sets the properties of the main window, and lets
all children of that main window inherit the style described by the "main
button" style.  The code used in the application is:

<tscreen><verb>
window = gtk_window_new (GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
gtk_widget_set_name (window, "main window");
</verb></tscreen>

And then the style is defined in the rc file using:

<tscreen><verb>
widget "main window.*GtkButton*" style "main_button"
</verb></tscreen>

Which sets all the Button widgets in the "main window" to the
"main_buttons" style as defined in the rc file.

As you can see, this is a fairly powerful and flexible system.  Use your
imagination as to how best to take advantage of this.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1>GTK's rc File Format
<p>
The format of the GTK file is illustrated in the example below. This is
the testgtkrc file from the GTK distribution, but I've added a
few comments and things. You may wish to include this explanation in
your application to allow the user to fine tune his application.

There are several directives to change the attributes of a widget.

<itemize>
<item>fg - Sets the foreground color of a widget.
<item>bg - Sets the background color of a widget.
<item>bg_pixmap - Sets the background of a widget to a tiled pixmap.
<item>font - Sets the font to be used with the given widget.
</itemize>

In addition to this, there are several states a widget can be in, and you
can set different colors, pixmaps and fonts for each state. These states are:

<itemize>
<item>NORMAL - The normal state of a widget, without the mouse over top of
it, and not being pressed, etc.
<item>PRELIGHT - When the mouse is over top of the widget, colors defined
using this state will be in effect.
<item>ACTIVE - When the widget is pressed or clicked it will be active, and
the attributes assigned by this tag will be in effect.
<item>INSENSITIVE - When a widget is set insensitive, and cannot be
activated, it will take these attributes.
<item>SELECTED - When an object is selected, it takes these attributes.
</itemize>

When using the "fg" and "bg" keywords to set the colors of widgets, the
format is:

<tscreen><verb>
fg[<STATE>] = { Red, Green, Blue }
</verb></tscreen>

Where STATE is one of the above states (PRELIGHT, ACTIVE, etc), and the Red,
Green and Blue are values in the range of 0 - 1.0,  { 1.0, 1.0, 1.0 } being
white. They must be in float form, or they will register as 0, so a straight 
"1" will not work, it must be "1.0".  A straight "0" is fine because it 
doesn't matter if it's not recognized.  Unrecognized values are set to 0.

bg_pixmap is very similar to the above, except the colors are replaced by a
filename.

pixmap_path is a list of paths separated by ":"'s.  These paths will be
searched for any pixmap you specify.

The font directive is simply:
<tscreen><verb>
font = "<font name>"
</verb></tscreen>

The only hard part is figuring out the font string. Using xfontsel or
a similar utility should help.

The "widget_class" sets the style of a class of widgets. These classes are
listed in the widget overview on the class hierarchy.

The "widget" directive sets a specifically named set of widgets to a
given style, overriding any style set for the given widget class.
These widgets are registered inside the application using the
gtk_widget_set_name() call. This allows you to specify the attributes of a
widget on a per widget basis, rather than setting the attributes of an
entire widget class. I urge you to document any of these special widgets so
users may customize them.

When the keyword <tt>parent</> is used as an attribute, the widget will take on
the attributes of its parent in the application.

When defining a style, you may assign the attributes of a previously defined
style to this new one.

<tscreen><verb>
style "main_button" = "button"
{
  font = "-adobe-helvetica-medium-r-normal--*-100-*-*-*-*-*-*"
  bg[PRELIGHT] = { 0.75, 0, 0 }
}
</verb></tscreen>

This example takes the "button" style, and creates a new "main_button" style
simply by changing the font and prelight background color of the "button"
style.

Of course, many of these attributes don't apply to all widgets. It's a
simple matter of common sense really. Anything that could apply, should.

<sect>Writing Your Own Widgets 
<!-- ***************************************************************** -->

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1> Overview
<p>
Although the GTK distribution comes with many types of widgets that
should cover most basic needs, there may come a time when you need to
create your own new widget type. Since GTK uses widget inheritance
extensively, and there is already a widget that is close to what you want,
it is often possible to make a useful new widget type in
just a few lines of code. But before starting work on a new widget, check
around first to make sure that someone has not already written
it. This will prevent duplication of effort and keep the number of
GTK widgets out there to a minimum, which will help keep both the code
and the interface of different applications consistent. As a flip side
to this, once you finish your widget, announce it to the world so
other people can benefit. The best place to do this is probably the
<tt>gtk-list</tt>.

Complete sources for the example widgets are available at the place you 
got this tutorial, or from:

<htmlurl url="http://www.gtk.org/~otaylor/gtk/tutorial/"
name="http://www.gtk.org/~otaylor/gtk/tutorial/">


<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1> The Anatomy Of A Widget
<p>
In order to create a new widget, it is important to have an
understanding of how GTK objects work. This section is just meant as a
brief overview. See the reference documentation for the details. 

GTK widgets are implemented in an object oriented fashion. However,
they are implemented in standard C. This greatly improves portability
and stability over using current generation C++ compilers; however,
it does mean that the widget writer has to pay attention to some of
the implementation details. The information common to all instances of
one class of widgets (e.g., to all Button widgets) is stored in the 
<em>class structure</em>. There is only one copy of this in
which is stored information about the class's signals
(which act like virtual functions in C). To support inheritance, the
first field in the class structure must be a copy of the parent's
class structure. The declaration of the class structure of GtkButtton
looks like:

<tscreen><verb>
struct _GtkButtonClass
{
  GtkContainerClass parent_class;

  void (* pressed)  (GtkButton *button);
  void (* released) (GtkButton *button);
  void (* clicked)  (GtkButton *button);
  void (* enter)    (GtkButton *button);
  void (* leave)    (GtkButton *button);
};
</verb></tscreen>

When a button is treated as a container (for instance, when it is
resized), its class structure can be cast to GtkContainerClass, and
the relevant fields used to handle the signals.

There is also a structure for each widget that is created on a
per-instance basis. This structure has fields to store information that
is different for each instance of the widget. We'll call this
structure the <em>object structure</em>. For the Button class, it looks
like:

<tscreen><verb>
struct _GtkButton
{
  GtkContainer container;

  GtkWidget *child;

  guint in_button : 1;
  guint button_down : 1;
};
</verb></tscreen>

Note that, similar to the class structure, the first field is the
object structure of the parent class, so that this structure can be
cast to the parent class' object structure as needed.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1> Creating a Composite widget

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect2> Introduction
<p>
One type of widget that you may be interested in creating is a
widget that is merely an aggregate of other GTK widgets. This type of
widget does nothing that couldn't be done without creating new
widgets, but provides a convenient way of packaging user interface
elements for reuse. The FileSelection and ColorSelection widgets in
the standard distribution are examples of this type of widget.

The example widget that we'll create in this section is the Tictactoe
widget, a 3x3 array of toggle buttons which triggers a signal when all
three buttons in a row, column, or on one of the diagonals are
depressed. 

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect2> Choosing a parent class
<p>
The parent class for a composite widget is typically the container
class that holds all of the elements of the composite widget. For
example, the parent class of the FileSelection widget is the
Dialog class. Since our buttons will be arranged in a table, it
might seem natural to make our parent class the Table
class. Unfortunately, this turns out not to work. The creation of a
widget is divided among two functions - a <tt/WIDGETNAME_new()/
function that the user calls, and a <tt/WIDGETNAME_init()/ function
which does the basic work of initializing the widget which is
independent of the arguments passed to the <tt/_new()/
function. Descendant widgets only call the <tt/_init/ function of
their parent widget. But this division of labor doesn't work well for
tables, which when created need to know the number of rows and
columns in the table. Unless we want to duplicate most of the
functionality of <tt/gtk_table_new()/ in our Tictactoe widget, we had
best avoid deriving it from Table. For that reason, we derive it
from VBox instead, and stick our table inside the VBox.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect2> The header file
<p>
Each widget class has a header file which declares the object and
class structures for that widget, along with public functions. 
A couple of features are worth pointing out. To prevent duplicate
definitions, we wrap the entire header file in:

<tscreen><verb>
#ifndef __TICTACTOE_H__
#define __TICTACTOE_H__
.
.
.
#endif /* __TICTACTOE_H__ */
</verb></tscreen>

And to keep C++ programs that include the header file happy, in:

<tscreen><verb>
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif /* __cplusplus */
.
.
.
#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif /* __cplusplus */
</verb></tscreen>

Along with the functions and structures, we declare three standard
macros in our header file, <tt/TICTACTOE(obj)/,
<tt/TICTACTOE_CLASS(klass)/, and <tt/IS_TICTACTOE(obj)/, which cast a
pointer into a pointer to the object or class structure, and check
if an object is a Tictactoe widget respectively.

Here is the complete header file:

<tscreen><verb>
/* tictactoe.h */

#ifndef __TICTACTOE_H__
#define __TICTACTOE_H__

#include <gdk/gdk.h>
#include <gtk/gtkvbox.h>

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif /* __cplusplus */

#define TICTACTOE(obj)          GTK_CHECK_CAST (obj, tictactoe_get_type (), Tictactoe)
#define TICTACTOE_CLASS(klass)  GTK_CHECK_CLASS_CAST (klass, tictactoe_get_type (), TictactoeClass)
#define IS_TICTACTOE(obj)       GTK_CHECK_TYPE (obj, tictactoe_get_type ())


typedef struct _Tictactoe       Tictactoe;
typedef struct _TictactoeClass  TictactoeClass;

struct _Tictactoe
{
  GtkVBox vbox;
  
  GtkWidget *buttons[3][3];
};

struct _TictactoeClass
{
  GtkVBoxClass parent_class;

  void (* tictactoe) (Tictactoe *ttt);
};

guint          tictactoe_get_type        (void);
GtkWidget*     tictactoe_new             (void);
void	       tictactoe_clear           (Tictactoe *ttt);

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif /* __cplusplus */

#endif /* __TICTACTOE_H__ */

</verb></tscreen>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect2> The <tt/_get_type()/ function.
<p>
We now continue on to the implementation of our widget. A core
function for every widget is the function
<tt/WIDGETNAME_get_type()/. This function, when first called, tells
GTK about the widget class, and gets an ID that uniquely identifies
the widget class. Upon subsequent calls, it just returns the ID.

<tscreen><verb>
guint
tictactoe_get_type ()
{
  static guint ttt_type = 0;

  if (!ttt_type)
    {
      GtkTypeInfo ttt_info =
      {
	"Tictactoe",
	sizeof (Tictactoe),
	sizeof (TictactoeClass),
	(GtkClassInitFunc) tictactoe_class_init,
	(GtkObjectInitFunc) tictactoe_init,
	(GtkArgSetFunc) NULL,
        (GtkArgGetFunc) NULL
      };

      ttt_type = gtk_type_unique (gtk_vbox_get_type (), &amp;ttt_info);
    }

  return ttt_type;
}
</verb></tscreen>

The GtkTypeInfo structure has the following definition:

<tscreen><verb>
struct _GtkTypeInfo
{
  gchar *type_name;
  guint object_size;
  guint class_size;
  GtkClassInitFunc class_init_func;
  GtkObjectInitFunc object_init_func;
  GtkArgSetFunc arg_set_func;
  GtkArgGetFunc arg_get_func;
};
</verb></tscreen>

The fields of this structure are pretty self-explanatory. We'll ignore
the <tt/arg_set_func/ and <tt/arg_get_func/ fields here: they have an important, 
but as yet largely
unimplemented, role in allowing widget options to be conveniently set
from interpreted languages. Once GTK has a correctly filled in copy of
this structure, it knows how to create objects of a particular widget
type. 

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect2> The <tt/_class_init()/ function
<p>
The <tt/WIDGETNAME_class_init()/ function initializes the fields of
the widget's class structure, and sets up any signals for the
class. For our Tictactoe widget it looks like:

<tscreen><verb>

enum {
  TICTACTOE_SIGNAL,
  LAST_SIGNAL
};

static gint tictactoe_signals[LAST_SIGNAL] = { 0 };

static void
tictactoe_class_init (TictactoeClass *class)
{
  GtkObjectClass *object_class;

  object_class = (GtkObjectClass*) class;
  
  tictactoe_signals[TICTACTOE_SIGNAL] = gtk_signal_new ("tictactoe",
					 GTK_RUN_FIRST,
					 object_class->type,
					 GTK_SIGNAL_OFFSET (TictactoeClass, tictactoe),
					 gtk_signal_default_marshaller, GTK_TYPE_NONE, 0);


  gtk_object_class_add_signals (object_class, tictactoe_signals, LAST_SIGNAL);

  class->tictactoe = NULL;
}
</verb></tscreen>

Our widget has just one signal, the <tt/tictactoe/ signal that is
invoked when a row, column, or diagonal is completely filled in. Not
every composite widget needs signals, so if you are reading this for
the first time, you may want to skip to the next section now, as
things are going to get a bit complicated.

The function:

<tscreen><verb>
gint gtk_signal_new( const gchar         *name,
                     GtkSignalRunType     run_type,
                     GtkType              object_type,
                     gint                 function_offset,
                     GtkSignalMarshaller  marshaller,
                     GtkType              return_val,
                     guint                nparams,
                     ...);
</verb></tscreen>

Creates a new signal. The parameters are:

<itemize>
<item> <tt/name/: The name of the signal.
<item> <tt/run_type/: Whether the default handler runs before or after
user handlers. Usually this will be <tt/GTK_RUN_FIRST/, or <tt/GTK_RUN_LAST/,
although there are other possibilities.
<item> <tt/object_type/: The ID of the object that this signal applies
to. (It will also apply to that objects descendants.)
<item> <tt/function_offset/: The offset within the class structure of
a pointer to the default handler.
<item> <tt/marshaller/: A function that is used to invoke the signal
handler. For signal handlers that have no arguments other than the
object that emitted the signal and user data, we can use the
pre-supplied marshaller function <tt/gtk_signal_default_marshaller/.
<item> <tt/return_val/: The type of the return val.
<item> <tt/nparams/: The number of parameters of the signal handler
(other than the two default ones mentioned above)
<item> <tt/.../: The types of the parameters.
</itemize>

When specifying types, the <tt/GtkType/ enumeration is used:

<tscreen><verb>
typedef enum
{
  GTK_TYPE_INVALID,
  GTK_TYPE_NONE,
  GTK_TYPE_CHAR,
  GTK_TYPE_BOOL,
  GTK_TYPE_INT,
  GTK_TYPE_UINT,
  GTK_TYPE_LONG,
  GTK_TYPE_ULONG,
  GTK_TYPE_FLOAT,
  GTK_TYPE_DOUBLE,
  GTK_TYPE_STRING,
  GTK_TYPE_ENUM,
  GTK_TYPE_FLAGS,
  GTK_TYPE_BOXED,
  GTK_TYPE_FOREIGN,
  GTK_TYPE_CALLBACK,
  GTK_TYPE_ARGS,

  GTK_TYPE_POINTER,

  /* it'd be great if the next two could be removed eventually */
  GTK_TYPE_SIGNAL,
  GTK_TYPE_C_CALLBACK,

  GTK_TYPE_OBJECT

} GtkFundamentalType;
</verb></tscreen>

<tt/gtk_signal_new()/ returns a unique integer identifier for the
signal, that we store in the <tt/tictactoe_signals/ array, which we
index using an enumeration. (Conventionally, the enumeration elements
are the signal name, uppercased, but here there would be a conflict
with the <tt/TICTACTOE()/ macro, so we called it <tt/TICTACTOE_SIGNAL/
instead.

After creating our signals, we need to tell GTK to associate our
signals with the Tictactoe class. We do that by calling
<tt/gtk_object_class_add_signals()/. We then set the pointer which
points to the default handler for the "tictactoe" signal to NULL,
indicating that there is no default action.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect2> The <tt/_init()/ function.
<p>
Each widget class also needs a function to initialize the object
structure. Usually, this function has the fairly limited role of
setting the fields of the structure to default values. For composite
widgets, however, this function also creates the component widgets.

<tscreen><verb>
static void
tictactoe_init (Tictactoe *ttt)
{
  GtkWidget *table;
  gint i,j;
  
  table = gtk_table_new (3, 3, TRUE);
  gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER(ttt), table);
  gtk_widget_show (table);

  for (i=0;i<3; i++)
    for (j=0;j<3; j++)
      {
	ttt->buttons[i][j] = gtk_toggle_button_new ();
	gtk_table_attach_defaults (GTK_TABLE(table), ttt->buttons[i][j], 
				   i, i+1, j, j+1);
	gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT (ttt->buttons[i][j]), "toggled",
			    GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (tictactoe_toggle), ttt);
	gtk_widget_set_usize (ttt->buttons[i][j], 20, 20);
	gtk_widget_show (ttt->buttons[i][j]);
      }
}
</verb></tscreen>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect2> And the rest...
<p>
There is one more function that every widget (except for base widget
types like Bin that cannot be instantiated) needs to have - the
function that the user calls to create an object of that type. This is
conventionally called <tt/WIDGETNAME_new()/. In some
widgets, though not for the Tictactoe widgets, this function takes
arguments, and does some setup based on the arguments. The other two
functions are specific to the Tictactoe widget. 

<tt/tictactoe_clear()/ is a public function that resets all the
buttons in the widget to the up position. Note the use of
<tt/gtk_signal_handler_block_by_data()/ to keep our signal handler for
button toggles from being triggered unnecessarily.

<tt/tictactoe_toggle()/ is the signal handler that is invoked when the
user clicks on a button. It checks to see if there are any winning
combinations that involve the toggled button, and if so, emits
the "tictactoe" signal.

<tscreen><verb>  
GtkWidget*
tictactoe_new ()
{
  return GTK_WIDGET ( gtk_type_new (tictactoe_get_type ()));
}

void	       
tictactoe_clear (Tictactoe *ttt)
{
  int i,j;

  for (i=0;i<3;i++)
    for (j=0;j<3;j++)
      {
	gtk_signal_handler_block_by_data (GTK_OBJECT(ttt->buttons[i][j]), ttt);
	gtk_toggle_button_set_active (GTK_TOGGLE_BUTTON (ttt->buttons[i][j]),
				     FALSE);
	gtk_signal_handler_unblock_by_data (GTK_OBJECT(ttt->buttons[i][j]), ttt);
      }
}

static void
tictactoe_toggle (GtkWidget *widget, Tictactoe *ttt)
{
  int i,k;

  static int rwins[8][3] = { { 0, 0, 0 }, { 1, 1, 1 }, { 2, 2, 2 },
			     { 0, 1, 2 }, { 0, 1, 2 }, { 0, 1, 2 },
			     { 0, 1, 2 }, { 0, 1, 2 } };
  static int cwins[8][3] = { { 0, 1, 2 }, { 0, 1, 2 }, { 0, 1, 2 },
			     { 0, 0, 0 }, { 1, 1, 1 }, { 2, 2, 2 },
			     { 0, 1, 2 }, { 2, 1, 0 } };

  int success, found;

  for (k=0; k<8; k++)
    {
      success = TRUE;
      found = FALSE;

      for (i=0;i<3;i++)
	{
	  success = success &amp;&amp; 
	    GTK_TOGGLE_BUTTON(ttt->buttons[rwins[k][i]][cwins[k][i]])->active;
	  found = found ||
	    ttt->buttons[rwins[k][i]][cwins[k][i]] == widget;
	}
      
      if (success &amp;&amp; found)
	{
	  gtk_signal_emit (GTK_OBJECT (ttt), 
			   tictactoe_signals[TICTACTOE_SIGNAL]);
	  break;
	}
    }
}
</verb></tscreen>

And finally, an example program using our Tictactoe widget:

<tscreen><verb>
#include <gtk/gtk.h>
#include "tictactoe.h"

/* Invoked when a row, column or diagonal is completed */
void
win (GtkWidget *widget, gpointer data)
{
  g_print ("Yay!\n");
  tictactoe_clear (TICTACTOE (widget));
}

int 
main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
  GtkWidget *window;
  GtkWidget *ttt;
  
  gtk_init (&amp;argc, &amp;argv);

  window = gtk_window_new (GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
  
  gtk_window_set_title (GTK_WINDOW (window), "Aspect Frame");
  
  gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT (window), "destroy",
		      GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (gtk_exit), NULL);
  
  gtk_container_set_border_width (GTK_CONTAINER (window), 10);

  /* Create a new Tictactoe widget */
  ttt = tictactoe_new ();
  gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (window), ttt);
  gtk_widget_show (ttt);

  /* And attach to its "tictactoe" signal */
  gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT (ttt), "tictactoe",
		      GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (win), NULL);

  gtk_widget_show (window);
  
  gtk_main ();
  
  return 0;
}

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1> Creating a widget from scratch.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect2> Introduction
<p>
In this section, we'll learn more about how widgets display themselves
on the screen and interact with events. As an example of this, we'll
create an analog dial widget with a pointer that the user can drag to
set the value.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect2> Displaying a widget on the screen
<p>
There are several steps that are involved in displaying on the screen.
After the widget is created with a call to <tt/WIDGETNAME_new()/,
several more functions are needed:

<itemize>
<item> <tt/WIDGETNAME_realize()/ is responsible for creating an X
window for the widget if it has one.
<item> <tt/WIDGETNAME_map()/ is invoked after the user calls
<tt/gtk_widget_show()/. It is responsible for making sure the widget
is actually drawn on the screen (<em/mapped/). For a container class,
it must also make calls to <tt/map()/> functions of any child widgets.
<item> <tt/WIDGETNAME_draw()/ is invoked when <tt/gtk_widget_draw()/
is called for the widget or one of its ancestors. It makes the actual
calls to the drawing functions to draw the widget on the screen. For
container widgets, this function must make calls to
<tt/gtk_widget_draw()/ for its child widgets.
<item> <tt/WIDGETNAME_expose()/ is a handler for expose events for the
widget. It makes the necessary calls to the drawing functions to draw
the exposed portion on the screen. For container widgets, this
function must generate expose events for its child widgets which don't
have their own windows. (If they have their own windows, then X will
generate the necessary expose events.)
</itemize>

You might notice that the last two functions are quite similar - each
is responsible for drawing the widget on the screen. In fact many
types of widgets don't really care about the difference between the
two. The default <tt/draw()/ function in the widget class simply
generates a synthetic expose event for the redrawn area. However, some
types of widgets can save work by distinguishing between the two
functions. For instance, if a widget has multiple X windows, then
since expose events identify the exposed window, it can redraw only
the affected window, which is not possible for calls to <tt/draw()/.

Container widgets, even if they don't care about the difference for
themselves, can't simply use the default <tt/draw()/ function because
their child widgets might care about the difference. However,
it would be wasteful to duplicate the drawing code between the two
functions. The convention is that such widgets have a function called
<tt/WIDGETNAME_paint()/ that does the actual work of drawing the
widget, that is then called by the <tt/draw()/ and <tt/expose()/
functions.

In our example approach, since the dial widget is not a container
widget, and only has a single window, we can take the simplest
approach and use the default <tt/draw()/ function and only implement
an <tt/expose()/ function.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect2> The origins of the Dial Widget
<p>
Just as all land animals are just variants on the first amphibian that
crawled up out of the mud, GTK widgets tend to start off as variants
of some other, previously written widget. Thus, although this section
is entitled "Creating a Widget from Scratch", the Dial widget really
began with the source code for the Range widget. This was picked as a
starting point because it would be nice if our Dial had the same
interface as the Scale widgets which are just specialized descendants
of the Range widget. So, though the source code is presented below in
finished form, it should not be implied that it was written, <em>ab
initio</em> in this fashion. Also, if you aren't yet familiar with
how scale widgets work from the application writer's point of view, it
would be a good idea to look them over before continuing.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect2> The Basics
<p>
Quite a bit of our widget should look pretty familiar from the
Tictactoe widget. First, we have a header file:

Since there is quite a bit more going on in this widget than the last
one, we have more fields in the data structure, but otherwise things
are pretty similar.

Next, after including header files and declaring a few constants,
we have some functions to provide information about the widget
and initialize it:

<tscreen><verb>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <gtk/gtkmain.h>
#include <gtk/gtksignal.h>

#include "gtkdial.h"

#define SCROLL_DELAY_LENGTH  300
#define DIAL_DEFAULT_SIZE 100

/* Forward declarations */

[ omitted to save space ]

/* Local data */

static GtkWidgetClass *parent_class = NULL;

guint
gtk_dial_get_type ()
{
  static guint dial_type = 0;

  if (!dial_type)
    {
      GtkTypeInfo dial_info =
      {
	"GtkDial",
	sizeof (GtkDial),
	sizeof (GtkDialClass),

      dial_type = gtk_type_unique (gtk_widget_get_type (), &amp;dial_info);
    }

  return dial_type;
}

  gtk_dial_set_adjustment (dial, adjustment);

  return GTK_WIDGET (dial);
}

static void
gtk_dial_destroy (GtkObject *object)
{
  GtkDial *dial;

  g_return_if_fail (object != NULL);
  g_return_if_fail (GTK_IS_DIAL (object));

  dial = GTK_DIAL (object);

  if (dial->adjustment)

  if (GTK_OBJECT_CLASS (parent_class)->destroy)
    (* GTK_OBJECT_CLASS (parent_class)->destroy) (object);
}
</verb></tscreen>

Note that this <tt/init()/ function does less than for the Tictactoe
widget, since this is not a composite widget, and the <tt/new()/
function does more, since it now has an argument. Also, note that when
we store a pointer to the Adjustment object, we increment its
reference count, (and correspondingly decrement it when we no longer
use it) so that GTK can keep track of when it can be safely destroyed.

<p>
Also, there are a few function to manipulate the widget's options:

<tscreen><verb>
GtkAdjustment*
gtk_dial_get_adjustment (GtkDial *dial)
{
  g_return_val_if_fail (dial != NULL, NULL);
  g_return_val_if_fail (GTK_IS_DIAL (dial), NULL);

  return dial->adjustment;
}

void
gtk_dial_set_update_policy (GtkDial      *dial,

  g_return_if_fail (dial != NULL);
  g_return_if_fail (GTK_IS_DIAL (dial));

  dial->policy = policy;
}

      gtk_object_unref (GTK_OBJECT (dial->adjustment));
    }

  dial->adjustment = adjustment;
  gtk_object_ref (GTK_OBJECT (dial->adjustment));

  gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT (adjustment), "changed",

<sect2> <tt/gtk_dial_realize()/

<p>
Now we come to some new types of functions. First, we have a function
that does the work of creating the X window. Notice that a mask is
passed to the function <tt/gdk_window_new()/ which specifies which fields of
the GdkWindowAttr structure actually have data in them (the remaining
fields will be given default values). Also worth noting is the way the
event mask of the widget is created. We call
<tt/gtk_widget_get_events()/ to retrieve the event mask that the user
has specified for this widget (with <tt/gtk_widget_set_events()/), and
add the events that we are interested in ourselves.

<p>
After creating the window, we set its style and background, and put a
pointer to the widget in the user data field of the GdkWindow. This
last step allows GTK to dispatch events for this window to the correct
widget.

<tscreen><verb>
static void
gtk_dial_realize (GtkWidget *widget)
{
  GtkDial *dial;
  GdkWindowAttr attributes;
  gint attributes_mask;

  g_return_if_fail (widget != NULL);
  g_return_if_fail (GTK_IS_DIAL (widget));

  GTK_WIDGET_SET_FLAGS (widget, GTK_REALIZED);
  dial = GTK_DIAL (widget);

  attributes.x = widget->allocation.x;
  attributes.y = widget->allocation.y;
  attributes.width = widget->allocation.width;
  attributes.height = widget->allocation.height;
  attributes.wclass = GDK_INPUT_OUTPUT;
  attributes.window_type = GDK_WINDOW_CHILD;
  attributes.event_mask = gtk_widget_get_events (widget) | 
    GDK_EXPOSURE_MASK | GDK_BUTTON_PRESS_MASK | 
    GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE_MASK | GDK_POINTER_MOTION_MASK |
    GDK_POINTER_MOTION_HINT_MASK;
  attributes.visual = gtk_widget_get_visual (widget);
  attributes.colormap = gtk_widget_get_colormap (widget);

  attributes_mask = GDK_WA_X | GDK_WA_Y | GDK_WA_VISUAL | GDK_WA_COLORMAP;
  widget->window = gdk_window_new (widget->parent->window, &amp;attributes, attributes_mask);

  widget->style = gtk_style_attach (widget->style, widget->window);

  gdk_window_set_user_data (widget->window, widget);

  gtk_style_set_background (widget->style, widget->window, GTK_STATE_ACTIVE);
}
</verb></tscreen>

<sect2> Size negotiation

<p>
Before the first time that the window containing a widget is
displayed, and whenever the layout of the window changes, GTK asks
each child widget for its desired size. This request is handled by the
function <tt/gtk_dial_size_request()/. Since our widget isn't a
container widget, and has no real constraints on its size, we just
return a reasonable default value.

<tscreen><verb>
static void 
gtk_dial_size_request (GtkWidget      *widget,
		       GtkRequisition *requisition)
{
  requisition->width = DIAL_DEFAULT_SIZE;
  requisition->height = DIAL_DEFAULT_SIZE;
}
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
After all the widgets have requested an ideal size, the layout of the
window is computed and each child widget is notified of its actual
size. Usually, this will be at least as large as the requested size,
but if for instance the user has resized the window, it may
occasionally be smaller than the requested size. The size notification
is handled by the function <tt/gtk_dial_size_allocate()/. Notice that
as well as computing the sizes of some component pieces for future
use, this routine also does the grunt work of moving the widget's X
window into the new position and size.

<tscreen><verb>
static void
gtk_dial_size_allocate (GtkWidget     *widget,
			GtkAllocation *allocation)
{
  GtkDial *dial;

  g_return_if_fail (widget != NULL);
  g_return_if_fail (GTK_IS_DIAL (widget));
  g_return_if_fail (allocation != NULL);

  widget->allocation = *allocation;
  if (GTK_WIDGET_REALIZED (widget))
    {
      dial = GTK_DIAL (widget);

      gdk_window_move_resize (widget->window,
			      allocation->x, allocation->y,
			      allocation->width, allocation->height);

      dial->radius = MAX(allocation->width,allocation->height) * 0.45;
      dial->pointer_width = dial->radius / 5;
    }
}

<sect2> <tt/gtk_dial_expose()/

<p>
As mentioned above, all the drawing of this widget is done in the
handler for expose events. There's not much to remark on here except
the use of the function <tt/gtk_draw_polygon/ to draw the pointer with
three dimensional shading according to the colors stored in the
widget's style.

<sect2> Event handling
<p>
The rest of the widget's code handles various types of events, and
isn't too different from what would be found in many GTK
applications. Two types of events can occur - either the user can
click on the widget with the mouse and drag to move the pointer, or
the value of the Adjustment object can change due to some external
circumstance. 

When the user clicks on the widget, we check to see if the click was
appropriately near the pointer, and if so, store the button that the
user clicked with in the <tt/button/ field of the widget
structure, and grab all mouse events with a call to
<tt/gtk_grab_add()/. Subsequent motion of the mouse causes the
value of the control to be recomputed (by the function
<tt/gtk_dial_update_mouse/). Depending on the policy that has been
set, "value_changed" events are either generated instantly
(<tt/GTK_UPDATE_CONTINUOUS/), after a delay in a timer added with
<tt/gtk_timeout_add()/ (<tt/GTK_UPDATE_DELAYED/), or only when the
button is released (<tt/GTK_UPDATE_DISCONTINUOUS/).

Changes to the Adjustment by external means are communicated to our

for these functions call <tt/gtk_dial_update()/ to validate the

calling <tt/gtk_widget_draw()/).

<sect2> Possible Enhancements
<p>
The Dial widget as we've described it so far runs about 670 lines of
code. Although that might sound like a fair bit, we've really
accomplished quite a bit with that much code, especially since much of
that length is headers and boilerplate. However, there are quite a few
more enhancements that could be made to this widget:

<itemize>
<item> If you try this widget out, you'll find that there is some
flashing as the pointer is dragged around. This is because the entire
widget is erased every time the pointer is moved before being
redrawn. Often, the best way to handle this problem is to draw to an
offscreen pixmap, then copy the final results onto the screen in one
step. (The ProgressBar widget draws itself in this fashion.)

<item> The user should be able to use the up and down arrow keys to
increase and decrease the value.

<item> It would be nice if the widget had buttons to increase and
decrease the value in small or large steps. Although it would be
possible to use embedded Button widgets for this, we would also like
the buttons to auto-repeat when held down, as the arrows on a
scrollbar do. Most of the code to implement this type of behavior can
be found in the Range widget.

<item> The Dial widget could be made into a container widget with a
single child widget positioned at the bottom between the buttons
mentioned above. The user could then add their choice of a label or
entry widget to display the current value of the dial.

</itemize>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1> Learning More

<p>
Only a small part of the many details involved in creating widgets
could be described above. If you want to write your own widgets, the
best source of examples is the GTK source itself. Ask yourself some
questions about the widget you want to write: IS it a Container
widget? Does it have its own window? Is it a modification of an
existing widget? Then find a similar widget, and start making changes.
Good luck!

<!-- ***************************************************************** -->
<sect>Scribble, A Simple Example Drawing Program
<!-- ***************************************************************** -->

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1> Overview
<p>
In this section, we will build a simple drawing program. In the
process, we will examine how to handle mouse events, how to draw in a
window, and how to do drawing better by using a backing pixmap. After
creating the simple drawing program, we will extend it by adding
support for XInput devices, such as drawing tablets. GTK provides
support routines which makes getting extended information, such as
pressure and tilt, from such devices quite easy.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1> Event Handling
<p>
The GTK signals we have already discussed are for high-level actions,
such as a menu item being selected. However, sometimes it is useful to
learn about lower-level occurrences, such as the mouse being moved, or
a key being pressed. There are also GTK signals corresponding to these
low-level <em>events</em>. The handlers for these signals have an
extra parameter which is a pointer to a structure containing
information about the event. For instance, motion event handlers are
passed a pointer to a GdkEventMotion structure which looks (in part)
like:

<tscreen><verb>
struct _GdkEventMotion
{
  GdkEventType type;
  GdkWindow *window;
  guint32 time;
  gdouble x;
  gdouble y;
  ...
  guint state;
  ...
};
</verb></tscreen>

<tt/type/ will be set to the event type, in this case
<tt/GDK_MOTION_NOTIFY/, window is the window in which the event
occurred. <tt/x/ and <tt/y/ give the coordinates of the event.
<tt/state/ specifies the modifier state when the event
occurred (that is, it specifies which modifier keys and mouse buttons
were pressed). It is the bitwise OR of some of the following:

<tscreen><verb>
GDK_SHIFT_MASK  
GDK_LOCK_MASK   
GDK_CONTROL_MASK
GDK_MOD1_MASK   
GDK_MOD2_MASK   
GDK_MOD3_MASK   
GDK_MOD4_MASK   
GDK_MOD5_MASK   
GDK_BUTTON1_MASK
GDK_BUTTON2_MASK
GDK_BUTTON3_MASK
GDK_BUTTON4_MASK
GDK_BUTTON5_MASK
</verb></tscreen>

As for other signals, to determine what happens when an event occurs
we call <tt>gtk_signal_connect()</tt>. But we also need let GTK
know which events we want to be notified about. To do this, we call
the function:

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_widget_set_events (GtkWidget *widget,
                            gint      events);
</verb></tscreen>

The second field specifies the events we are interested in. It
is the bitwise OR of constants that specify different types
of events. For future reference the event types are:

<tscreen><verb>
GDK_EXPOSURE_MASK
GDK_POINTER_MOTION_MASK
GDK_POINTER_MOTION_HINT_MASK
GDK_BUTTON_MOTION_MASK     
GDK_BUTTON1_MOTION_MASK    
GDK_BUTTON2_MOTION_MASK    
GDK_BUTTON3_MOTION_MASK    
GDK_BUTTON_PRESS_MASK      
GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE_MASK    
GDK_KEY_PRESS_MASK         
GDK_KEY_RELEASE_MASK       
GDK_ENTER_NOTIFY_MASK      
GDK_LEAVE_NOTIFY_MASK      
GDK_FOCUS_CHANGE_MASK      
GDK_STRUCTURE_MASK         
GDK_PROPERTY_CHANGE_MASK   
GDK_PROXIMITY_IN_MASK      
GDK_PROXIMITY_OUT_MASK     
</verb></tscreen>

There are a few subtle points that have to be observed when calling
<tt/gtk_widget_set_events()/. First, it must be called before the X window
for a GTK widget is created. In practical terms, this means you
should call it immediately after creating the widget. Second, the
widget must have an associated X window. For efficiency, many widget
types do not have their own window, but draw in their parent's window.
These widgets are:

<tscreen><verb>
GtkAlignment
GtkArrow
GtkBin
GtkBox
GtkImage
GtkItem
GtkLabel
GtkPixmap
GtkScrolledWindow
GtkSeparator
GtkTable
GtkAspectFrame
GtkFrame
GtkVBox
GtkHBox
GtkVSeparator
GtkHSeparator
</verb></tscreen>

To capture events for these widgets, you need to use an EventBox
widget. See the section on the <ref id="sec_EventBox"
name="EventBox"> widget for details.

For our drawing program, we want to know when the mouse button is
pressed and when the mouse is moved, so we specify
<tt/GDK_POINTER_MOTION_MASK/ and <tt/GDK_BUTTON_PRESS_MASK/. We also
want to know when we need to redraw our window, so we specify
<tt/GDK_EXPOSURE_MASK/. Although we want to be notified via a
Configure event when our window size changes, we don't have to specify
the corresponding <tt/GDK_STRUCTURE_MASK/ flag, because it is
automatically specified for all windows.

It turns out, however, that there is a problem with just specifying
<tt/GDK_POINTER_MOTION_MASK/. This will cause the server to add a new
motion event to the event queue every time the user moves the mouse.
Imagine that it takes us 0.1 seconds to handle a motion event, but the
X server queues a new motion event every 0.05 seconds. We will soon
get way behind the users drawing. If the user draws for 5 seconds,
it will take us another 5 seconds to catch up after they release 
the mouse button! What we would like is to only get one motion
event for each event we process. The way to do this is to 
specify <tt/GDK_POINTER_MOTION_HINT_MASK/. 

When we specify <tt/GDK_POINTER_MOTION_HINT_MASK/, the server sends
us a motion event the first time the pointer moves after entering
our window, or after a button press or release event. Subsequent 
motion events will be suppressed until we explicitly ask for
the position of the pointer using the function:

<tscreen><verb>
GdkWindow*    gdk_window_get_pointer     (GdkWindow       *window,
					  gint            *x,
					  gint            *y,
					  GdkModifierType *mask);
</verb></tscreen>

(There is another function, <tt>gtk_widget_get_pointer()</tt> which
has a simpler interface, but turns out not to be very useful, since
it only retrieves the position of the mouse, not whether the buttons
are pressed.)

The code to set the events for our window then looks like:

<tscreen><verb>
  gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT (drawing_area), "expose_event",
		      (GtkSignalFunc) expose_event, NULL);
  gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT(drawing_area),"configure_event",
		      (GtkSignalFunc) configure_event, NULL);
  gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT (drawing_area), "motion_notify_event",
		      (GtkSignalFunc) motion_notify_event, NULL);
  gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT (drawing_area), "button_press_event",
		      (GtkSignalFunc) button_press_event, NULL);

  gtk_widget_set_events (drawing_area, GDK_EXPOSURE_MASK
			 | GDK_LEAVE_NOTIFY_MASK
			 | GDK_BUTTON_PRESS_MASK
			 | GDK_POINTER_MOTION_MASK
			 | GDK_POINTER_MOTION_HINT_MASK);
</verb></tscreen>

We'll save the "expose_event" and "configure_event" handlers for
later. The "motion_notify_event" and "button_press_event" handlers
are pretty simple:

<tscreen><verb>
static gint
button_press_event (GtkWidget *widget, GdkEventButton *event)

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1> The DrawingArea Widget, And Drawing
<p>
We now turn to the process of drawing on the screen. The 
widget we use for this is the DrawingArea widget. A drawing area
widget is essentially an X window and nothing more. It is a blank
canvas in which we can draw whatever we like. A drawing area
is created using the call:

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget* gtk_drawing_area_new        (void);
</verb></tscreen>

A default size for the widget can be specified by calling:

<tscreen><verb>
void       gtk_drawing_area_size       (GtkDrawingArea      *darea,
					gint                 width,
					gint                 height);
</verb></tscreen>

This default size can be overridden, as is true for all widgets,
by calling <tt>gtk_widget_set_usize()</tt>, and that, in turn, can
be overridden if the user manually resizes the the window containing
the drawing area.

It should be noted that when we create a DrawingArea widget, we are
<em>completely</em> responsible for drawing the contents. If our
window is obscured then uncovered, we get an exposure event and must
redraw what was previously hidden.

Having to remember everything that was drawn on the screen so we
can properly redraw it can, to say the least, be a nuisance. In
addition, it can be visually distracting if portions of the
window are cleared, then redrawn step by step. The solution to
this problem is to use an offscreen <em>backing pixmap</em>.
Instead of drawing directly to the screen, we draw to an image
stored in server memory but not displayed, then when the image
changes or new portions of the image are displayed, we copy the
relevant portions onto the screen.

To create an offscreen pixmap, we call the function:

<tscreen><verb>
GdkPixmap* gdk_pixmap_new               (GdkWindow  *window,
					 gint        width,
					 gint        height,
					 gint        depth);
</verb></tscreen>

The <tt>window</tt> parameter specifies a GDK window that this pixmap
takes some of its properties from. <tt>width</tt> and <tt>height</tt>
specify the size of the pixmap. <tt>depth</tt> specifies the <em>color
depth</em>, that is the number of bits per pixel, for the new window.
If the depth is specified as <tt>-1</tt>, it will match the depth
of <tt>window</tt>.

We create the pixmap in our "configure_event" handler. This event
is generated whenever the window changes size, including when it
is originally created.

<tscreen><verb>
/* Backing pixmap for drawing area */
static GdkPixmap *pixmap = NULL;

/* Create a new backing pixmap of the appropriate size */
static gint
configure_event (GtkWidget *widget, GdkEventConfigure *event)
{
  if (pixmap)
    gdk_pixmap_unref(pixmap);

  pixmap = gdk_pixmap_new(widget->window,
			  widget->allocation.width,
			  widget->allocation.height,
			  -1);
  gdk_draw_rectangle (pixmap,
		      widget->style->white_gc,
		      TRUE,
		      0, 0,
		      widget->allocation.width,
		      widget->allocation.height);

  return TRUE;
}
</verb></tscreen>

The call to <tt>gdk_draw_rectangle()</tt> clears the pixmap
initially to white. We'll say more about that in a moment.

Our exposure event handler then simply copies the relevant portion
of the pixmap onto the screen (we determine the area we need
to redraw by using the event->area field of the exposure event):

<tscreen><verb>
/* Redraw the screen from the backing pixmap */
static gint
expose_event (GtkWidget *widget, GdkEventExpose *event)
{
  gdk_draw_pixmap(widget->window,
		  widget->style->fg_gc[GTK_WIDGET_STATE (widget)],
		  pixmap,
		  event->area.x, event->area.y,
		  event->area.x, event->area.y,
		  event->area.width, event->area.height);

  return FALSE;
}
</verb></tscreen>

We've now seen how to keep the screen up to date with our pixmap, but
how do we actually draw interesting stuff on our pixmap?  There are a
large number of calls in GTK's GDK library for drawing on
<em>drawables</em>. A drawable is simply something that can be drawn
upon. It can be a window, a pixmap, or a bitmap (a black and white
image).  We've already seen two such calls above,
<tt>gdk_draw_rectangle()</tt> and <tt>gdk_draw_pixmap()</tt>. The
complete list is:

<tscreen><verb>
gdk_draw_line ()
gdk_draw_rectangle ()
gdk_draw_arc ()
gdk_draw_polygon ()
gdk_draw_string ()
gdk_draw_text ()
gdk_draw_pixmap ()
gdk_draw_bitmap ()
gdk_draw_image ()
gdk_draw_points ()
gdk_draw_segments ()
</verb></tscreen>

See the reference documentation or the header file
<tt>&lt;gdk/gdk.h&gt;</tt> for further details on these functions.
These functions all share the same first two arguments. The first
argument is the drawable to draw upon, the second argument is a
<em>graphics context</em> (GC). 

A graphics context encapsulates information about things such as
foreground and background color and line width. GDK has a full set of
functions for creating and modifying graphics contexts, but to keep
things simple we'll just use predefined graphics contexts. Each widget
has an associated style. (Which can be modified in a gtkrc file, see
the section GTK's rc file.) This, among other things, stores a number
of graphics contexts. Some examples of accessing these graphics
contexts are:

<tscreen><verb>
widget->style->white_gc
widget->style->black_gc
widget->style->fg_gc[GTK_STATE_NORMAL]
widget->style->bg_gc[GTK_WIDGET_STATE(widget)]
</verb></tscreen>

The fields <tt>fg_gc</tt>, <tt>bg_gc</tt>, <tt>dark_gc</tt>, and
<tt>light_gc</tt> are indexed by a parameter of type
<tt>GtkStateType</tt> which can take on the values:

<tscreen><verb>
GTK_STATE_NORMAL,
GTK_STATE_ACTIVE,
GTK_STATE_PRELIGHT,
GTK_STATE_SELECTED,
GTK_STATE_INSENSITIVE
</verb></tscreen>

For instance, for <tt/GTK_STATE_SELECTED/ the default foreground
color is white and the default background color, dark blue.

Our function <tt>draw_brush()</tt>, which does the actual drawing
on the screen, is then:

<tscreen><verb>
/* Draw a rectangle on the screen */
static void
draw_brush (GtkWidget *widget, gdouble x, gdouble y)
{
  GdkRectangle update_rect;

  update_rect.x = x - 5;
  update_rect.y = y - 5;
  update_rect.width = 10;
  update_rect.height = 10;
  gdk_draw_rectangle (pixmap,
		      widget->style->black_gc,
		      TRUE,
		      update_rect.x, update_rect.y,
		      update_rect.width, update_rect.height);
  gtk_widget_draw (widget, &amp;update_rect);
}
</verb></tscreen>

After we draw the rectangle representing the brush onto the pixmap,
we call the function:

<tscreen><verb>
void       gtk_widget_draw                (GtkWidget           *widget,
					   GdkRectangle        *area);
</verb></tscreen>

which notifies X that the area given by the <tt>area</tt> parameter
needs to be updated. X will eventually generate an expose event
(possibly combining the areas passed in several calls to
<tt>gtk_widget_draw()</tt>) which will cause our expose event handler
to copy the relevant portions to the screen.

We have now covered the entire drawing program except for a few
mundane details like creating the main window.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1> Adding XInput support
<p>
It is now possible to buy quite inexpensive input devices such 
as drawing tablets, which allow drawing with a much greater
ease of artistic expression than does a mouse. The simplest way
to use such devices is simply as a replacement for the mouse,
but that misses out many of the advantages of these devices,
such as:

<itemize>
<item> Pressure sensitivity
<item> Tilt reporting
<item> Sub-pixel positioning
<item> Multiple inputs (for example, a stylus with a point and eraser)
</itemize>

For information about the XInput extension, see the <htmlurl
url="http://www.msc.cornell.edu/~otaylor/xinput/XInput-HOWTO.html"
name="XInput-HOWTO">.

If we examine the full definition of, for example, the GdkEventMotion
structure, we see that it has fields to support extended device
information.

<tscreen><verb>
struct _GdkEventMotion
{
  GdkEventType type;
  GdkWindow *window;
  guint32 time;
  gdouble x;
  gdouble y;
  gdouble pressure;
  gdouble xtilt;
  gdouble ytilt;
  guint state;
  gint16 is_hint;
  GdkInputSource source;
  guint32 deviceid;
};
</verb></tscreen>

<tt/pressure/ gives the pressure as a floating point number between
0 and 1. <tt/xtilt/ and <tt/ytilt/ can take on values between 
-1 and 1, corresponding to the degree of tilt in each direction.
<tt/source/ and <tt/deviceid/ specify the device for which the
event occurred in two different ways. <tt/source/ gives some simple
information about the type of device. It can take the enumeration
values:

<tscreen><verb>
GDK_SOURCE_MOUSE
GDK_SOURCE_PEN
GDK_SOURCE_ERASER
GDK_SOURCE_CURSOR
</verb></tscreen>

<tt/deviceid/ specifies a unique numeric ID for the device. This can
be used to find out further information about the device using the
<tt/gdk_input_list_devices()/ call (see below). The special value
<tt/GDK_CORE_POINTER/ is used for the core pointer device. (Usually
the mouse.)

<sect2> Enabling extended device information
<p>
To let GTK know about our interest in the extended device information,
we merely have to add a single line to our program:

<tscreen><verb>
gtk_widget_set_extension_events (drawing_area, GDK_EXTENSION_EVENTS_CURSOR);
</verb></tscreen>

By giving the value <tt/GDK_EXTENSION_EVENTS_CURSOR/ we say that
we are interested in extension events, but only if we don't have
to draw our own cursor. See the section <ref
id="sec_Further_Sophistications" name="Further Sophistications"> below
for more information about drawing the cursor. We could also 
give the values <tt/GDK_EXTENSION_EVENTS_ALL/ if we were willing 
to draw our own cursor, or <tt/GDK_EXTENSION_EVENTS_NONE/ to revert
back to the default condition.

This is not completely the end of the story however. By default,
no extension devices are enabled. We need a mechanism to allow
users to enable and configure their extension devices. GTK provides
the InputDialog widget to automate this process. The following
procedure manages an InputDialog widget. It creates the dialog if
it isn't present, and raises it to the top otherwise.

<tscreen><verb>
void
input_dialog_destroy (GtkWidget *w, gpointer data)
{
  *((GtkWidget **)data) = NULL;
}

void
create_input_dialog ()
{
  static GtkWidget *inputd = NULL;

  if (!inputd)
    {
      inputd = gtk_input_dialog_new();

      gtk_signal_connect (GTK_OBJECT(inputd), "destroy",
			  (GtkSignalFunc)input_dialog_destroy, &amp;inputd);
      gtk_signal_connect_object (GTK_OBJECT(GTK_INPUT_DIALOG(inputd)->close_button),
				 "clicked",
				 (GtkSignalFunc)gtk_widget_hide,
				 GTK_OBJECT(inputd));
      gtk_widget_hide ( GTK_INPUT_DIALOG(inputd)->save_button);

      gtk_widget_show (inputd);
    }
  else
    {
      if (!GTK_WIDGET_MAPPED(inputd))
	gtk_widget_show(inputd);
      else
	gdk_window_raise(inputd->window);
    }
}
</verb></tscreen>

(You might want to take note of the way we handle this dialog.  By
connecting to the "destroy" signal, we make sure that we don't keep a
pointer to dialog around after it is destroyed - that could lead to a
segfault.)

The InputDialog has two buttons "Close" and "Save", which by default
have no actions assigned to them. In the above function we make
"Close" hide the dialog, hide the "Save" button, since we don't
implement saving of XInput options in this program.

<sect2> Using extended device information
<p>
Once we've enabled the device, we can just use the extended 
device information in the extra fields of the event structures.
In fact, it is always safe to use this information since these
fields will have reasonable default values even when extended
events are not enabled.

Once change we do have to make is to call
<tt/gdk_input_window_get_pointer()/ instead of
<tt/gdk_window_get_pointer/. This is necessary because
<tt/gdk_window_get_pointer/ doesn't return the extended device
information.

<tscreen><verb>
void gdk_input_window_get_pointer( GdkWindow       *window,
                                   guint32         deviceid,
                                   gdouble         *x,
                                   gdouble         *y,
                                   gdouble         *pressure,
                                   gdouble         *xtilt,
                                   gdouble         *ytilt,
                                   GdkModifierType *mask);
</verb></tscreen>

When calling this function, we need to specify the device ID as
well as the window. Usually, we'll get the device ID from the
<tt/deviceid/ field of an event structure. Again, this function
will return reasonable values when extension events are not
enabled. (In this case, <tt/event->deviceid/ will have the value
<tt/GDK_CORE_POINTER/).

So the basic structure of our button-press and motion event handlers
doesn't change much - we just need to add code to deal with the
extended information.

<tscreen><verb>
static gint
button_press_event (GtkWidget *widget, GdkEventButton *event)
{
  print_button_press (event->deviceid);
  
  if (event->button == 1 &amp;&amp; pixmap != NULL)
    draw_brush (widget, event->source, event->x, event->y, event->pressure);

  return TRUE;
}

static gint
motion_notify_event (GtkWidget *widget, GdkEventMotion *event)
{
  gdouble x, y;
  gdouble pressure;
  GdkModifierType state;

  if (event->is_hint)
    gdk_input_window_get_pointer (event->window, event->deviceid,
				  &amp;x, &amp;y, &amp;pressure, NULL, NULL, &amp;state);
  else
    {
      x = event->x;
      y = event->y;
      pressure = event->pressure;
      state = event->state;
    }
    
  if (state &amp; GDK_BUTTON1_MASK &amp;&amp; pixmap != NULL)
    draw_brush (widget, event->source, x, y, pressure);
  
  return TRUE;
}
</verb></tscreen>

We also need to do something with the new information. Our new
<tt/draw_brush()/ function draws with a different color for
each <tt/event->source/ and changes the brush size depending
on the pressure.

<tscreen><verb>
/* Draw a rectangle on the screen, size depending on pressure,
   and color on the type of device */
static void
draw_brush (GtkWidget *widget, GdkInputSource source,
	    gdouble x, gdouble y, gdouble pressure)
{
  GdkGC *gc;
  GdkRectangle update_rect;

  switch (source)
    {
    case GDK_SOURCE_MOUSE:
      gc = widget->style->dark_gc[GTK_WIDGET_STATE (widget)];
      break;
    case GDK_SOURCE_PEN:
      gc = widget->style->black_gc;
      break;
    case GDK_SOURCE_ERASER:
      gc = widget->style->white_gc;
      break;
    default:
      gc = widget->style->light_gc[GTK_WIDGET_STATE (widget)];
    }

  update_rect.x = x - 10 * pressure;
  update_rect.y = y - 10 * pressure;
  update_rect.width = 20 * pressure;
  update_rect.height = 20 * pressure;
  gdk_draw_rectangle (pixmap, gc, TRUE,
		      update_rect.x, update_rect.y,
		      update_rect.width, update_rect.height);
  gtk_widget_draw (widget, &amp;update_rect);
}
</verb></tscreen>

<sect2> Finding out more about a device
<p>
As an example of how to find out more about a device, our program
will print the name of the device that generates each button
press. To find out the name of a device, we call the function:

<tscreen><verb>
GList *gdk_input_list_devices               (void);
</verb></tscreen>

which returns a GList (a linked list type from the GLib library)
of GdkDeviceInfo structures. The GdkDeviceInfo structure is defined
as:

<tscreen><verb>
struct _GdkDeviceInfo
{
  guint32 deviceid;
  gchar *name;
  GdkInputSource source;
  GdkInputMode mode;
  gint has_cursor;
  gint num_axes;
  GdkAxisUse *axes;
  gint num_keys;
  GdkDeviceKey *keys;
};
</verb></tscreen>

Most of these fields are configuration information that you can ignore
unless you are implementing XInput configuration saving. The fieldwe
are interested in here is <tt/name/ which is simply the name that X
assigns to the device. The other field that isn't configuration
information is <tt/has_cursor/. If <tt/has_cursor/ is false, then we
we need to draw our own cursor. But since we've specified
<tt/GDK_EXTENSION_EVENTS_CURSOR/, we don't have to worry about this.

Our <tt/print_button_press()/ function simply iterates through
the returned list until it finds a match, then prints out
the name of the device.

<tscreen><verb>
static void
print_button_press (guint32 deviceid)
{
  GList *tmp_list;

  /* gdk_input_list_devices returns an internal list, so we shouldn't
     free it afterwards */
  tmp_list = gdk_input_list_devices();

  while (tmp_list)
    {
      GdkDeviceInfo *info = (GdkDeviceInfo *)tmp_list->data;

      if (info->deviceid == deviceid)
	{
	  printf("Button press on device '%s'\n", info->name);
	  return;
	}

      tmp_list = tmp_list->next;
    }
}
</verb></tscreen>

That completes the changes to "XInputize" our program.

<sect2> Further sophistications <label id="sec_Further_Sophistications">
<p>
Although our program now supports XInput quite well, it lacks some
features we would want in a full-featured application. First, the user
probably doesn't want to have to configure their device each time they
run the program, so we should allow them to save the device
configuration. This is done by iterating through the return of
<tt/gdk_input_list_devices()/ and writing out the configuration to a
file.

To restore the state next time the program is run, GDK provides
functions to change device configuration:

<tscreen><verb>
gdk_input_set_extension_events()
gdk_input_set_source()
gdk_input_set_mode()
gdk_input_set_axes()
gdk_input_set_key()
</verb></tscreen>

(The list returned from <tt/gdk_input_list_devices()/ should not be
modified directly.) An example of doing this can be found in the
drawing program gsumi. (Available from <htmlurl
url="http://www.msc.cornell.edu/~otaylor/gsumi/"
name="http://www.msc.cornell.edu/~otaylor/gsumi/">) Eventually, it
would be nice to have a standard way of doing this for all
applications. This probably belongs at a slightly higher level than
GTK, perhaps in the GNOME library.

Another major omission that we have mentioned above is the lack of
cursor drawing. Platforms other than XFree86 currently do not allow
simultaneously using a device as both the core pointer and directly by
an application. See the <url
url="http://www.msc.cornell.edu/~otaylor/xinput/XInput-HOWTO.html"
name="XInput-HOWTO"> for more information about this. This means that
applications that want to support the widest audience need to draw
their own cursor.

An application that draws its own cursor needs to do two things:
determine if the current device needs a cursor drawn or not, and
determine if the current device is in proximity. (If the current
device is a drawing tablet, it's a nice touch to make the cursor 
disappear when the stylus is lifted from the tablet. When the
device is touching the stylus, that is called "in proximity.")
The first is done by searching the device list, as we did
to find out the device name. The second is achieved by selecting
"proximity_out" events. An example of drawing one's own cursor is
found in the "testinput" program found in the GTK distribution.

<sect>Tips For Writing GTK Applications
<!-- ***************************************************************** -->
<p>
This section is simply a gathering of wisdom, general style guidelines
and hints to creating good GTK applications. Currently this section
is very short, but I hope it will get longer in future editions of
this tutorial.

Use GNU autoconf and automake! They are your friends :) Automake
examines C files, determines how they depend on each other, and
generates a Makefile so the files can be compiled in the correct
order. Autoconf permits automatic configuration of software
installation, handling a large number of system quirks to increase
portability. I am planning to make a quick intro on them here.

When writing C code, use only C comments (beginning with "/*" and
ending with "*/"), and don't use C++-style comments ("//").  Although
many C compilers understand C++ comments, others don't, and the ANSI C
standard does not require that C++-style comments be processed as
comments.

The data type <tt/GdkEventType/ is a special data type that is used by
all the other data types as an indicator of the data type being passed
to the signal handler. As you will see below, each of the event data
structures has a member of this type. It is defined as an enumeration
type as follows:

<tscreen><verb>
typedef enum
{
  GDK_NOTHING           = -1,
  GDK_DELETE            = 0,
  GDK_DESTROY           = 1,
  GDK_EXPOSE            = 2,
  GDK_MOTION_NOTIFY     = 3,
  GDK_BUTTON_PRESS      = 4,
  GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS     = 5,
  GDK_3BUTTON_PRESS     = 6,
  GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE    = 7,
  GDK_KEY_PRESS         = 8,
  GDK_KEY_RELEASE       = 9,
  GDK_ENTER_NOTIFY      = 10,
  GDK_LEAVE_NOTIFY      = 11,
  GDK_FOCUS_CHANGE      = 12,
  GDK_CONFIGURE         = 13,
  GDK_MAP               = 14,
  GDK_UNMAP             = 15,
  GDK_PROPERTY_NOTIFY   = 16,
  GDK_SELECTION_CLEAR   = 17,
  GDK_SELECTION_REQUEST = 18,
  GDK_SELECTION_NOTIFY  = 19,
  GDK_PROXIMITY_IN      = 20,
  GDK_PROXIMITY_OUT     = 21,
  GDK_DRAG_BEGIN        = 22,
  GDK_DRAG_REQUEST      = 23,
  GDK_DROP_ENTER        = 24,
  GDK_DROP_LEAVE        = 25,
  GDK_DROP_DATA_AVAIL   = 26,
  GDK_CLIENT_EVENT      = 27,
  GDK_VISIBILITY_NOTIFY = 28,
  GDK_NO_EXPOSE         = 29,
  GDK_OTHER_EVENT       = 9999  /* Deprecated, use filters instead */
} GdkEventType;
</verb></tscreen>

The other event type that is different from the others is
<tt/GdkEvent/ itself. This is a union of all the other
data types, which allows it to be cast to a specific
event data type within a signal handler.

<!-- Just a big list for now, needs expanding upon - TRG -->
So, the event data types are defined as follows:

<!-- ***************************************************************** -->
<sect> List Widget
<!-- ***************************************************************** -->
<p>
NOTE: The List widget has been superseded by the CList widget. It is
detailed here just for completeness.

The List widget is designed to act as a vertical container for
widgets that should be of the type ListItem.

A List widget has its own window to receive events and its own
background color which is usually white. As it is directly derived
from a Container it can be treated as such by using the
GTK_CONTAINER(List) macro, see the Container widget for more on
this. One should already be familiar with the usage of a GList and
its related functions g_list_*() to be able to use the List widget
to it full extent.

There is one field inside the structure definition of the List
widget that will be of greater interest to us, this is:

<tscreen><verb>
struct _GtkList
{
  ...
  GList *selection;
  guint selection_mode;
  ...
}; 
</verb></tscreen>

The selection field of a List points to a linked list of all items
that are currently selected, or NULL if the selection is empty.  So to
learn about the current selection we read the GTK_LIST()->selection
field, but do not modify it since the internal fields are maintained
by the gtk_list_*() functions.

The selection_mode of the List determines the selection facilities
of a List and therefore the contents of the GTK_LIST()->selection
field. The selection_mode may be one of the following:

<itemize>
<item> <tt/GTK_SELECTION_SINGLE/ - The selection is either NULL
                        or contains a GList pointer
                        for a single selected item.

<item> <tt/GTK_SELECTION_BROWSE/ -  The selection is NULL if the list
                        contains no widgets or insensitive
                        ones only, otherwise it contains
                        a GList pointer for one GList
                        structure, and therefore exactly
                        one list item.

<item> <tt/GTK_SELECTION_MULTIPLE/ -  The selection is NULL if no list
                        items are selected or a GList pointer
                        for the first selected item. That
                        in turn points to a GList structure
                        for the second selected item and so
                        on.

<item> <tt/GTK_SELECTION_EXTENDED/ - The selection is always NULL.
</itemize>

The default is <tt/GTK_SELECTION_MULTIPLE/.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1> Signals
<p>
<tscreen><verb>
void selection_changed( GtkList *list );
</verb></tscreen>

This signal will be invoked whenever the selection field of a List
has changed. This happens when a child of thekList got selected or
deselected.

<tscreen><verb>
void select_child( GtkList   *list,
                   GtkWidget *child);
</verb></tscreen>

This signal is invoked when a child of the List is about to get
selected. This happens mainly on calls to gtk_list_select_item(),
gtk_list_select_child(), button presses and sometimes indirectly
triggered on some else occasions where children get added to or
removed from the List.

<tscreen><verb>
void unselect_child( GtkList   *list,
                     GtkWidget *child );
</verb></tscreen>

This signal is invoked when a child of the List is about to get
deselected. This happens mainly on calls to gtk_list_unselect_item(),
gtk_list_unselect_child(), button presses and sometimes indirectly
triggered on some else occasions where children get added to or
removed from the List.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1> Functions
<p>
<tscreen><verb>
guint gtk_list_get_type( void );
</verb></tscreen>

Returns the "GtkList" type identifier.

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_list_new( void );
</verb></tscreen>

Create a new List object. The new widget is returned as a pointer
to a GtkWidget object. NULL is returned on failure.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_list_insert_items( GtkList *list,
                            GList   *items,
                            gint     position );
</verb></tscreen>

Insert list items into the list, starting at <tt/position/.
<tt/items/ is a doubly linked list where each nodes data pointer is
expected to point to a newly created ListItem. The GList nodes of
<tt/items/ are taken over by the list.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_list_append_items( GtkList *list,
                            GList   *items);
</verb></tscreen>

Insert list items just like gtk_list_insert_items() at the end of the
list. The GList nodes of <tt/items/ are taken over by the list.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_list_prepend_items( GtkList *list,
                             GList   *items);
</verb></tscreen>

Insert list items just like gtk_list_insert_items() at the very
beginning of the list. The GList nodes of <tt/items/ are taken over by
the list.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_list_remove_items( GtkList *list,
                            GList   *items);
</verb></tscreen>

Remove list items from the list. <tt/items/ is a doubly linked list
where each nodes data pointer is expected to point to a direct child
of list. It is the callers responsibility to make a call to
g_list_free(items) afterwards. Also the caller has to destroy the list
items himself.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_list_clear_items( GtkList *list,
                           gint start,
                           gint end );
</verb></tscreen>

Remove and destroy list items from the list. A widget is affected if
its current position within the list is in the range specified by
<tt/start/ and <tt/end/.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_list_select_item( GtkList *list,
                           gint     item );
</verb></tscreen>

Invoke the select_child signal for a list item specified through its
current position within the list.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_list_unselect_item( GtkList *list,
                             gint     item);
</verb></tscreen>

Invoke the unselect_child signal for a list item specified through its
current position within the list.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_list_select_child( GtkList *list,
                            GtkWidget *child);
</verb></tscreen>

Invoke the select_child signal for the specified child.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_list_unselect_child( GtkList   *list,
                              GtkWidget *child);
</verb></tscreen>

Invoke the unselect_child signal for the specified child.

<tscreen><verb>
gint gtk_list_child_position( GtkList *list,
                              GtkWidget *child);
</verb></tscreen>

Return the position of <tt/child/ within the list. "-1" is returned on
failure.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_list_set_selection_mode( GtkList         *list,
                                  GtkSelectionMode mode );
</verb></tscreen>

Set the selection mode MODE which can be of GTK_SELECTION_SINGLE,
GTK_SELECTION_BROWSE, GTK_SELECTION_MULTIPLE or
GTK_SELECTION_EXTENDED.

<tscreen><verb>
GtkList *GTK_LIST( gpointer obj );
</verb></tscreen>

Cast a generic pointer to "GtkList *".

<tscreen><verb>
GtkListClass *GTK_LIST_CLASS( gpointer class);
</verb></tscreen>

Cast a generic pointer to "GtkListClass *". 

<tscreen><verb>
gint GTK_IS_LIST( gpointer obj);
</verb></tscreen>

Determine if a generic pointer refers to a "GtkList" object.

<sect1> List Item Widget
<p>
The ListItem widget is designed to act as a container holding up to
one child, providing functions for selection/deselection just like the
List widget requires them for its children.

A ListItem has its own window to receive events and has its own
background color which is usually white.

As it is directly derived from an Item it can be treated as such by
using the GTK_ITEM(ListItem) macro, see the Item widget for more on
this. Usually a ListItem just holds a label to identify, e.g., a
filename within a List -- therefore the convenience function
gtk_list_item_new_with_label() is provided. The same effect can be
achieved by creating a Label on its own, setting its alignment to
xalign=0 and yalign=0.5 with a subsequent container addition to the
ListItem.

As one is not forced to add a GtkLabel to a GtkListItem, you could
also add a GtkVBox or a GtkArrow etc. to the GtkListItem.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1> Signals
<p>
AkListItem does not create new signals on its own, but inherits
the signals of a Item.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<sect1> Functions
<p>
<tscreen><verb>
guint gtk_list_item_get_type( void );
</verb></tscreen>

Returns the "GtkListItem" type identifier.

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_list_item_new( void );
</verb></tscreen>

Create a new ListItem object. The new widget is returned as a
pointer to a GtkWidget object. NULL is returned on failure.

<tscreen><verb>
GtkWidget *gtk_list_item_new_with_label( gchar *label );
</verb></tscreen>

Create a new ListItem object, having a single GtkLabel as the sole
child. The new widget is returned as a pointer to a GtkWidget
object. NULL is returned on failure.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_list_item_select( GtkListItem *list_item );
</verb></tscreen>

This function is basically a wrapper around a call to gtk_item_select
(GTK_ITEM (list_item)) which will emit the select signal.  *Note
GtkItem::, for more info.

<tscreen><verb>
void gtk_list_item_deselect( GtkListItem *list_item );
</verb></tscreen>

This function is basically a wrapper around a call to
gtk_item_deselect (GTK_ITEM (list_item)) which will emit the deselect
signal.  *Note GtkItem::, for more info.

<tscreen><verb>
GtkListItem *GTK_LIST_ITEM( gpointer obj );
</verb></tscreen>

Cast a generic pointer to "GtkListItem *".

<tscreen><verb>
GtkListItemClass *GTK_LIST_ITEM_CLASS( gpointer class );
</verb></tscreen>

Cast a generic pointer to GtkListItemClass*. *Note Standard Macros::,
for more info.

<tscreen><verb>
gint GTK_IS_LIST_ITEM( gpointer obj );
</verb></tscreen>

Determine if a generic pointer refers to a `GtkListItem' object.
*Note Standard Macros::, for more info.
