<!-- ##### SECTION Title ##### -->
Event Structures

<!-- ##### SECTION Short_Description ##### -->
data structures specific to each type of event.

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
<para>
The event structs contain data specific to each type of event in GDK.
</para>
<note>
<para>
A common mistake is to forget to set the event mask of a widget so that the
required events are received. See gtk_widget_set_events().
</para>
</note>

</para>

<!-- ##### UNION GdkEvent ##### -->
<para>
The #GdkEvent struct contains a union of all of the event structs,
and allows access to the data fields in a number of ways.
</para>
<para>
The event type is always the first field in all of the event structs, and
can always be accessed with the following code, no matter what type of event
it is:
<informalexample>
<programlisting>
  GdkEvent *event;  
  GdkEventType type;

  type = event->type;
</programlisting>
</informalexample>
</para>

<para>
To access other fields of the event structs, the pointer to the event can be
cast to the appropriate event struct pointer, or the union member name can be
used. For example if the event type is %GDK_BUTTON_PRESS then the x coordinate
of the button press can be accessed with:
<informalexample>
<programlisting>
  GdkEvent *event;  
  gdouble x;

  x = ((GdkEventButton*)event)->x;
</programlisting>
</informalexample>
or:
<informalexample>
<programlisting>
  GdkEvent *event;  
  gdouble x;

  x = event->button.x;
</programlisting>
</informalexample>
</para>


<!-- ##### STRUCT GdkEventAny ##### -->
<para>
Contains the fields which are common to all event structs.
Any event pointer can safely be cast to a pointer to a #GdkEventAny to access
these fields.
</para>

@type: the type of the event.
@window: the window which received the event.
@send_event: %TRUE if the event was sent explicitly (e.g. using 
<function>XSendEvent</function>).

<!-- ##### STRUCT GdkEventKey ##### -->
<para>
Describes a key press or key release event.
</para>

@type: the type of the event (%GDK_KEY_PRESS or %GDK_KEY_RELEASE).
@window: the window which received the event.
@send_event: %TRUE if the event was sent explicitly (e.g. using 
<function>XSendEvent</function>).
@time: the time of the event in milliseconds.
@state: a bit-mask representing the state of the modifier keys (e.g. Control,
Shift and Alt) and the pointer buttons. See #GdkModifierType.
@keyval: the key that was pressed or released. See the <filename>&lt;gdk/gdkkeysym.h&gt;</filename>
header file for a complete list of GDK key codes.
@length: the length of @string.
@string: a nul-terminated multi-byte string containing the composed characters
resulting from the key press. When text is being input, in a #GtkEntry for
example, it is these characters which should be added to the input buffer.
When using <link linkend="gdk-Input-Methods">Input Methods</link> to support
internationalized text input, the composed characters appear here after the
pre-editing has been completed.
@hardware_keycode: the raw code of the key that was pressed or released.
@group: the keyboard group.

<!-- ##### STRUCT GdkEventButton ##### -->
<para>
Used for button press and button release events. The
<structfield>type</structfield> field will be one of %GDK_BUTTON_PRESS,
%GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS, %GDK_3BUTTON_PRESS, and %GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE.
</para>
<para>
Double and triple-clicks result in a sequence of events being received.
For double-clicks the order of events will be:
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>%GDK_BUTTON_PRESS</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>%GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>%GDK_BUTTON_PRESS</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>%GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>%GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
Note that the first click is received just like a normal
button press, while the second click results in a %GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS being
received just after the %GDK_BUTTON_PRESS.
</para>
<para>
Triple-clicks are very similar to double-clicks, except that %GDK_3BUTTON_PRESS
is inserted after the third click. The order of the events is:
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>%GDK_BUTTON_PRESS</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>%GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>%GDK_BUTTON_PRESS</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>%GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>%GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>%GDK_BUTTON_PRESS</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>%GDK_3BUTTON_PRESS</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>%GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
</para>
<para>
For a double click to occur, the second button press must occur within 1/4 of
a second of the first. For a triple click to occur, the third button press
must also occur within 1/2 second of the first button press.
</para>
