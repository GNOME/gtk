Functions for drawing points, lines, arcs, and text

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
<para>
These functions provide support for drawing points, lines, arcs and text
onto what are called 'drawables'. Drawables, as the name suggests, are things
which support drawing onto them, and are either #GdkWindow or #GdkPixmap
objects.
</para>
<para>
Many of the drawing operations take a #GdkGC argument, which represents a
graphics context. This #GdkGC contains a number of drawing attributes such
as foreground color, background color and line width, and is used to reduce
the number of arguments needed for each drawing operation. See the
<link linkend="gdk-Graphics-Contexts">Graphics Contexts</link> section for
more information.
</para>
<para id="pango-data-structures">
Some of the drawing operations take Pango data structures like #PangoContext,
#PangoLayout or #PangoLayoutLine as arguments. If you're using GTK+, the ususal 
way to obtain these structures is via gtk_widget_create_pango_context() or
gtk_widget_create_pango_layout().
