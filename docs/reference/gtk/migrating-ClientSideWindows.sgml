  <title>Migrating to client-side windows</title>

  <para>
    In version 2.18, GDK has been changed to use client-side windows. This
    means that there is no longer a 1-1 correspondence between #GdkWindows
    and windows in the underlying window system. In particular, it is no
    longer correct to assume that each window has an associated XID.
    Code that makes this assumption can sometimes be fixed by calling
    gdk_window_ensure_native() on the windows in question.
  </para>

  <para>
    GDK looks for the <envvar>GDK_NATIVE_WINDOWS</envvar> environment variable
    and makes all windows native if it is set. It also tries to be more
    compatible with the way prior versions worked in some other ways.
  </para>

  <para>
    Some applications assume that they can just operate on the X windows
    corresponding to their GDK windows without ever telling GDK. One
    example that we've seen is changing the child window stacking order
    using XRestackWindows(). Fixing this properly requires to fix the code
    to use GDK functions to achieve whatever it is trying to achieve.
  </para>

  <para>
    One change that can cause problems for some applications is that GDK
    is more aggressive about optimizing away expose events. Code that does
    more than just repainting exposed areas in response to expose events
    may be affected by this.
