A shared pool of GdkGC objects

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
<para>
These functions provide access to a shared pool of #GdkGC objects.
When a new #GdkGC is needed, gtk_gc_get() is called with the required depth,
colormap and #GdkGCValues. If a #GdkGC with the required properties already
exists then that is returned. If not, a new #GdkGC is created.
When the #GdkGC is no longer needed, gtk_gc_release() should be called.

<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_gc_get ##### -->
<para>
Gets a #GdkGC with the given depth, colormap and #GdkGCValues.
If a #GdkGC with the given properties already exists then it is returned,
otherwise a new #GdkGC is created.
The returned #GdkGC should be released with gtk_gc_release() when it is no
longer needed.
</para>

@depth: the depth of the #GdkGC to create.
@colormap: the #GdkColormap (FIXME: I don't know why this is needed).
@values: a #GdkGCValues struct containing settings for the #GdkGC.
@values_mask: a set of flags indicating which of the fields in @values has
been set.
@Returns: a #GdkGC.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_gc_release ##### -->
<para>
Releases a #GdkGC allocated using gtk_gc_get().
</para>

@gc: a #GdkGC.
