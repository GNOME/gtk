A subclass of GtkCurve for editing gamma curves

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
<para>
The #GtkGammaCurve widget is a variant of #GtkCurve specifically for
editing gamma curves, which are used in graphics applications such as the
Gimp.
</para>
<para>
The #GtkGammaCurve widget shows a curve which the user can edit with the 
mouse just like a #GtkCurve widget. On the right of the curve it also displays
5 buttons, 3 of which change between the 3 curve modes (spline, linear and
free), and the other 2 set the curve to a particular gamma value, or reset it
to a straight line.
</para>
<para>
As of GTK+ 2.20, #GtkGammaCurve has been deprecated since it is too specialized.
