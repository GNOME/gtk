Version Information

<!-- ##### SECTION Short_Description ##### -->
variables and functions to check the GTK+ version.

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
<para>
GTK+ provides version information, primarily useful in configure checks
for builds that have a configure script. Applications will not
typically use the features described here.

<!-- ##### VARIABLE gtk_major_version ##### -->
<para>
The major version number of the GTK+ library.  (e.g. in GTK+ version
1.2.5 this is 1.) 
</para>

<para>
This variable is in the library, so represents the
GTK+ library you have linked against. Contrast with the
#GTK_MAJOR_VERSION macro, which represents the major version of the
GTK+ headers you have included.
</para>


<!-- ##### VARIABLE gtk_minor_version ##### -->
<para>
The minor version number of the GTK+ library.
(e.g. in GTK+ version 1.2.5 this is 2.)
</para>

<para>
This variable is in the library, so represents the
GTK+ library you have linked against. Contrast with the
#GTK_MINOR_VERSION macro, which represents the minor version of the
GTK+ headers you have included.
</para>


<!-- ##### VARIABLE gtk_micro_version ##### -->
<para>
The micro version number of the GTK+ library.
(e.g. in GTK+ version 1.2.5 this is 5.)
</para>


<para>
This variable is in the library, so represents the GTK+ library you
have linked against. Contrast with the #GTK_MICRO_VERSION macro, which
represents the micro version of the GTK+ headers you have included.
</para>


<!-- ##### VARIABLE gtk_binary_age ##### -->
<para>
This is the binary age passed to <application>libtool</application>. If 
<application>libtool</application> means nothing to you, don't worry 
about it. ;-)
</para>


<!-- ##### VARIABLE gtk_interface_age ##### -->
<para>
This is the interface age passed to <application>libtool</application>. If 
<application>libtool</application> means nothing to you, don't worry 
about it. ;-)
</para>


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_check_version ##### -->
<para>
Checks that the GTK+ library in use is equal to the given 
version. Primarily useful to compare the header file version 
(from #GTK_MAJOR_VERSION, #GTK_MINOR_VERSION, #GTK_MICRO_VERSION) 
the the runtime library version. This should only be done 
in the build for your application, to check that the user's libraries
and header files are the same. Applications should not do this 
when deployed, because it's OK for applications to use a different
micro version of GTK+ than the one they were compiled against.
</para>

@required_major: the required major version.
@required_minor: the required major version.
@required_micro: the required major version.
@Returns: %NULL if the GTK+ library is compatible with the given version, or
a string describing the version mismatch.


<!-- ##### MACRO GTK_MAJOR_VERSION ##### -->
<para>
Like #gtk_major_version, but from the headers used at
application compile time, rather than from the library linked against
at application run time.
</para>



<!-- ##### MACRO GTK_MINOR_VERSION ##### -->
<para>
Like #gtk_minor_version, but from the headers used at
application compile time, rather than from the library linked against
at application run time.
</para>



<!-- ##### MACRO GTK_MICRO_VERSION ##### -->
<para>
Like #gtk_micro_version, but from the headers used at
application compile time, rather than from the library linked against
at application run time.
</para>



<!-- ##### MACRO GTK_BINARY_AGE ##### -->
<para>
Like #gtk_binary_age, but from the headers used at
application compile time, rather than from the library linked against
at application run time.
</para>



<!-- ##### MACRO GTK_INTERFACE_AGE ##### -->
<para>
Like #gtk_interface_age, but from the headers used at
application compile time, rather than from the library linked against
at application run time.
</para>



<!-- ##### MACRO GTK_CHECK_VERSION ##### -->
<para>
Returns %TRUE if the version of the GTK+ header files is the same
as the passed-in version.
</para>

@major: major version (e.g. 1 for version 1.2.5)
@minor: minor version (e.g. 2 for version 1.2.5)
@micro: micro version (e.g. 5 for version 1.2.5)
