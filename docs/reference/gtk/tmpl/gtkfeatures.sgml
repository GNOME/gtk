Variables and functions to check the GTK+ version

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
<para>
GTK+ provides version information, primarily useful in configure checks
for builds that have a configure script. Applications will not
typically use the features described here.

<!-- ##### VARIABLE gtk_major_version ##### -->
<para>
The major version number of the GTK+ library.  (e.g. in GTK+ version
1.2.5 this is 1.) 
</para>

<para>
This variable is in the library, so represents the
GTK+ library you have linked against. Contrast with the
#GTK_MAJOR_VERSION macro, which represents the major version of the
GTK+ headers you have included.
</para>


<!-- ##### VARIABLE gtk_minor_version ##### -->
<para>
The minor version number of the GTK+ library.
(e.g. in GTK+ version 1.2.5 this is 2.)
</para>

<para>
This variable is in the library, so represents the
GTK+ library you have linked against. Contrast with the
#GTK_MINOR_VERSION macro, which represents the minor version of the
GTK+ headers you have included.
</para>


<!-- ##### VARIABLE gtk_micro_version ##### -->
<para>
The micro version number of the GTK+ library.
(e.g. in GTK+ version 1.2.5 this is 5.)
</para>


<para>
This variable is in the library, so represents the GTK+ library you
have linked against. Contrast with the #GTK_MICRO_VERSION macro, which
represents the micro version of the GTK+ headers you have included.
</para>


<!-- ##### VARIABLE gtk_binary_age ##### -->
<para>
This is the binary age passed to <application>libtool</application>. If 
<application>libtool</application> means nothing to you, don't worry 
about it. ;-)
</para>


<!-- ##### VARIABLE gtk_interface_age ##### -->
<para>
This is the interface age passed to <application>libtool</application>. If 
<application>libtool</application> means nothing to you, don't worry 
about it. ;-)
</para>

<!-- ##### MACRO GTK_MAJOR_VERSION ##### -->
<para>
Like #gtk_major_version, but from the headers used at
application compile time, rather than from the library linked against
at application run time.
</para>



<!-- ##### MACRO GTK_MINOR_VERSION ##### -->
<para>
Like #gtk_minor_version, but from the headers used at
application compile time, rather than from the library linked against
at application run time.
</para>



<!-- ##### MACRO GTK_MICRO_VERSION ##### -->
<para>
Like #gtk_micro_version, but from the headers used at
application compile time, rather than from the library linked against
at application run time.
</para>



<!-- ##### MACRO GTK_BINARY_AGE ##### -->
<para>
Like #gtk_binary_age, but from the headers used at
application compile time, rather than from the library linked against
at application run time.
</para>



<!-- ##### MACRO GTK_INTERFACE_AGE ##### -->
<para>
Like #gtk_interface_age, but from the headers used at
application compile time, rather than from the library linked against
at application run time.
</para>



<!-- ##### MACRO GTK_CHECK_VERSION ##### -->
<para>
Returns %TRUE if the version of the GTK+ header files is the same 
as or newer than the passed-in version.
</para>

@major: major version (e.g. 1 for version 1.2.5)
@minor: minor version (e.g. 2 for version 1.2.5)
@micro: micro version (e.g. 5 for version 1.2.5)
