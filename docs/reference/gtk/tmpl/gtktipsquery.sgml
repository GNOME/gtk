GtkTipsQuery

<!-- ##### SECTION Short_Description ##### -->
Displays help about widgets in the user interface

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
<para>
The #GtkTipsQuery widget is a subclass of #GtkLabel which is used to display
help about widgets in a user interface.
</para>
<para>
A query is started with a call to gtk_tips_query_start_query(), usually
when some kind of 'Help' button is pressed. The #GtkTipsQuery then grabs all
events, stopping the user interface from functioning normally.
Then as the user moves the mouse over the widgets, the #GtkTipsQuery displays
each widget's tooltip text.
</para>
<para>
By connecting to the "widget-entered" or "widget-selected" signals, it is
possible to customize the #GtkTipsQuery to perform other actions when widgets
are entered or selected. For example, a help browser could be opened with
documentation on the widget selected.
</para>
<para>
At some point a call to gtk_tips_query_stop_query() must be made in order to
stop the query and return the interface to its normal state.
The gtk_tips_query_set_caller() function can be used to specify a widget
which the user can select to stop the query (often the same button used to
start the query).
