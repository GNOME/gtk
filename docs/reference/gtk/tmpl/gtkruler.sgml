 This widget is considered too specialized/little-used for
 GTK+, and will be removed in GTK 3.  If your application needs this widget,
 feel free to use it, as the widget is useful in some applications; it's just
 not of general interest. However, we are not accepting new features for the
 widget, and it will move out of the GTK+ distribution.

The GTKRuler widget is a base class for horizontal and vertical rulers. Rulers
are used to show the mouse pointer's location in a window. The ruler can either
be horizontal or vertical on the window. Within the ruler a small triangle
indicates the location of the mouse relative to the horizontal or vertical
ruler. See #GtkHRuler to learn how to create a new horizontal ruler. See
#GtkVRuler to learn how to create a new vertical ruler.

All distances are in 1/72nd's of an inch. (According to Adobe thats a point, but
points are really 1/72.27 in.)

This should be points_per_unit. This is the size of the unit in 1/72nd's of an inch and has nothing to do with screen pixels.

This calls the #GTKMetricType to set the ruler to units defined. Available units
are GTK_PIXELS, GTK_INCHES, or GTK_CENTIMETERS. The default unit of measurement
is GTK_PIXELS.
