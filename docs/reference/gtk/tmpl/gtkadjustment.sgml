<!-- ##### SECTION Title ##### -->
GtkAdjustment

<!-- ##### SECTION Short_Description ##### -->
a #GtkObject representing an adjustable bounded value.

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
<para>
The #GtkAdjustment object represents a value which has an associated lower
and upper bound, together with step and page increments, and a page size.
It is used within several GTK+ widgets, including
#GtkSpinButton, #GtkViewport, and #GtkRange (which is a base class for
#GtkHScrollbar, #GtkVScrollbar, #GtkHScale, and #GtkVScale).
</para>
<para>
The #GtkAdjustment object does not update the value itself. Instead
it is left up to the owner of the #GtkAdjustment to control the value.
</para>
<para>
The owner of the #GtkAdjustment typically calls the
gtk_adjustment_value_changed() and gtk_adjustment_changed() functions
after changing the value and its bounds. This results in the emission of the
&quot;value_changed&quot; or &quot;changed&quot; signal respectively.

<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_adjustment_new ##### -->
<para>
Creates a new #GtkAdjustment.
</para>

@value: the initial value.
@lower: the minimum value.
@upper: the maximum value.
@step_increment: the step increment.
@page_increment: the page increment.
@page_size: the page size.
@Returns: a new #GtkAdjustment.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_adjustment_set_value ##### -->
<para>
Sets the #GtkAdjustment value.
</para>

@adjustment: a #GtkAdjustment.
@value: the new value.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_adjustment_clamp_page ##### -->
<para>
Updates the #GtkAdjustment @value to ensure that the range between @lower
and @upper is in the current page (i.e. between @value and @value +
@page_size).
If the range is larger than the page size, then only the start of it will
be in the current page.
A &quot;changed&quot; signal will be emitted if the value is changed.
</para>

@adjustment: a #GtkAdjustment.
@lower: the lower value.
@upper: the upper value.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_adjustment_changed ##### -->
<para>
Emits a &quot;changed&quot; signal from the #GtkAdjustment.
This is typically called by the owner of the #GtkAdjustment after it has
changed any of the #GtkAdjustment fields other than the value.
</para>

@adjustment: 


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_adjustment_value_changed ##### -->
<para>
Emits a &quot;value_changed&quot; signal from the #GtkAdjusmtent.
This is typically called by the owner of the #GtkAdjustment after it has
changed the #GtkAdjustment value field.
</para>

@adjustment: 


<!-- ##### SIGNAL GtkAdjustment::changed ##### -->
<para>
Emitted when one or more of the #GtkAdjustment fields have been changed,
other than the value field.
</para>

@adjustment: the object which received the signal.

<!-- ##### SIGNAL GtkAdjustment::value-changed ##### -->
<para>
Emitted when the #GtkAdjustment value field has been changed.
</para>

@adjustment: the object which received the signal.
