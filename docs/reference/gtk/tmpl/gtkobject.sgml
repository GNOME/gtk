<para>
#GtkObject is the base class for all widgets, and for a few 
non-widget objects such as #GtkAdjustment. #GtkObject predates 
#GObject; non-widgets that derive from #GtkObject rather than 
#GObject do so for backward compatibility reasons.
</para>
<para>
The most interesting difference between #GtkObject and #GObject is the
"floating" reference count. A #GObject is created with a reference count of 1,
owned by the creator of the #GObject. (The owner of a reference is the code
section that has the right to call g_object_unref() in order to remove that
reference.)  A #GtkObject is created with a reference count of 1 also, but it
isn't owned by anyone; calling g_object_unref() on the newly-created #GtkObject
is incorrect. Instead, the initial reference count of a #GtkObject is "floating". 
The floating reference can be removed by anyone at any time, by calling
gtk_object_sink(). gtk_object_sink() does nothing if an object is already 
sunk (has no floating reference).
</para>
<para>
When you add a widget to its parent container, the parent container
will do this:
<programlisting>
  g_object_ref (G_OBJECT (child_widget));
  gtk_object_sink (GTK_OBJECT (child_widget));
</programlisting>
This means that the container now owns a reference to the child widget (since 
it called g_object_ref()), and the child widget has no floating reference.
</para>
<para>
The purpose of the floating reference is to keep the child widget alive 
until you add it to a parent container:
<programlisting>
   button = gtk_button_new ();
   /* button has one floating reference to keep it alive */
   gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (container), button);
   /* button has one non-floating reference owned by the container */
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
#GtkWindow is a special case, because GTK+ itself will ref/sink it on creation. 
That is, after calling gtk_window_new(), the #GtkWindow will have one 
reference which is owned by GTK+, and no floating references.
</para>

<para>
One more factor comes into play: the "destroy" signal, emitted by the
gtk_object_destroy() method. The "destroy" signal asks all code owning a
reference to an object to release said reference. So, for example, if you call
gtk_object_destroy() on a #GtkWindow, GTK+ will release the reference count that
it owns; if you call gtk_object_destroy() on a #GtkButton, then the button will
be removed from its parent container and the parent container will release its
reference to the button.  Because these references are released, calling
gtk_object_destroy() should result in freeing all memory associated with an
object, unless some buggy code fails to release its references in response to
the "destroy" signal. Freeing memory (referred to as
<firstterm>finalization</firstterm> only happens if the reference count reaches
zero.
</para>

<para>
Some simple rules for handling #GtkObject:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>
Never call g_object_unref() unless you have previously called g_object_ref(), 
even if you created the #GtkObject. (Note: this is <emphasis>not</emphasis>
true for #GObject; for #GObject, the creator of the object owns a reference.)
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
Call gtk_object_destroy() to get rid of most objects in most cases. 
In particular, widgets are almost always destroyed in this way.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para> Because of the floating reference count, you don't need to
worry about reference counting for widgets and toplevel windows, unless you
explicitly call g_object_ref() yourself.  </para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<!-- ##### ENUM GtkObjectFlags ##### -->
<para>
Tells about the state of the object.
</para>

@GTK_IN_DESTRUCTION: 
@GTK_FLOATING: whether the object is orphaned.  Objects that take
strong hold of an object may gtk_object_sink() it, after obtaining
there own references, if they believe they are nearly primary
ownership of the object.
GTK_CONNECTED: refers to whether are signals are connected to this
object.
@GTK_RESERVED_1: reserved for future use
@GTK_RESERVED_2: reserved for future use

<!-- ##### MACRO GTK_OBJECT_FLAGS ##### -->
<para>
Gets the #GtkObjectFlags for an object without directly
accessing its members.
</para>

@obj: the object whose flags are returned.


<!-- ##### MACRO GTK_OBJECT_FLOATING ##### -->
<para>
Evaluates to %TRUE if the object still has its floating reference count.
See the overview documentation for #GtkObject.
</para>

@obj: the object to examine.


<!-- ##### MACRO GTK_OBJECT_CONNECTED ##### -->
<para>
Tests whether a #GtkObject has had a signal connected to it.
</para>

@obj: the object to examine.


<!-- ##### MACRO GTK_OBJECT_SET_FLAGS ##### -->
<para>
Turns on certain object flags.  (Private)
</para>

@obj: the object to affect.
@flag: the flags to set.


<!-- ##### MACRO GTK_OBJECT_UNSET_FLAGS ##### -->
<para>
Turns off certain object flags.  (Private)
</para>

@obj: the object to affect.
@flag: the flags to unset.


<!-- ##### ENUM GtkArgFlags ##### -->
<para>
Possible flags indicating how an argument should be treated.
Deprecated in favor of #GParamSpec features.
</para>

@GTK_ARG_READABLE: the argument is readable. (i.e. can be queried)
@GTK_ARG_WRITABLE: the argument is writable. (i.e. settable)
@GTK_ARG_CONSTRUCT: the argument needs construction.
@GTK_ARG_CONSTRUCT_ONLY: the argument needs construction (and will
be set once during object creation), but is otherwise cannot be
set.  Hence this flag is not allowed with #GTK_ARG_WRITABLE,
and is redundant with #GTK_ARG_CONSTRUCT.
@GTK_ARG_CHILD_ARG: an argument type that applies to (and may be different for)
each child.  Used by #GtkContainer.

<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_new ##### -->
<para>
Constructs an object given its arguments, enumerated in the call to the
function. Deprecated in favor of g_object_new().
</para>

@type: the type identifying this object.  Returned by gtk_type_unique()
(although for a properly-written object it should be accessible through
a #GTK_TYPE_FOO macro.)
@first_property_name: name of the first property to set when constructing
   the object.
@Varargs: the first argument's value, followed by any number of
name/argument-value pairs, terminated with %NULL.
@Returns: the new #GtkObject.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_sink ##### -->
<para>
Removes the floating reference from a #GtkObject, if it exists; 
otherwise does nothing. See the #GtkObject overview documentation at 
the top of the page.
</para>

@object: the object to sink.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_ref ##### -->
<para>
Increases the reference count of the object.
Deprecated in favor of g_object_ref().
</para>

@object: the object to reference.
@Returns: @object.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_unref ##### -->
<para>
Decreases the reference count of an object.  When its reference count drops 
to 0, the object is finalized (i.e. its memory is freed).  Deprecated in 
favor of g_object_unref(). 
</para>

@object: the object to dereference.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_weakref ##### -->
<para>
Adds a weak reference callback to an object. Deprecated in favor of
g_object_weak_ref(). Weak references are used for notification when an object is
finalized. They are called "weak references" because they allow you to safely
hold a pointer to an object without calling g_object_ref() (g_object_ref() adds
a strong reference, that is, forces the object to stay alive).
</para>

@object: object to weakly reference.
@notify: callback to invoke before the object is freed.
@data: extra data to pass to #notify.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_weakunref ##### -->
<para>
Removes a weak reference callback to an object.
</para>

@object: object stop weakly referencing.
@notify: callback to search for.
@data: data to search for.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_destroy ##### -->
<para>
Emits the "destroy" signal notifying all reference holders that they should
release the #GtkObject. See the overview documentation at the top of the 
page for more details.
</para>
<para>
The memory for the object itself won't be deleted until
its reference count actually drops to 0; gtk_object_destroy() merely asks 
reference holders to release their references, it does not free the object.
</para>

@object: the object to destroy.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_get ##### -->
<para>
Gets properties of an object. Deprecated in favor of g_object_get().  
</para>

@object: a #GtkObject.

@Varargs: %NULL-terminated list of name-return location pairs.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_set ##### -->

                                  "spacing", 8,
				  NULL);
}
</programlisting>
</informalexample>
</para>

@object: a #GtkObject.
@first_property_name: name of the first property to set
@Varargs: the value of the first argument, followed optionally
by more name/value pairs, followed by %NULL.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_set_data ##### -->
<para>
Deprecated in favor of g_object_set_data().
Each object carries around a table of associations from
strings to pointers.  This function lets you set an association.
</para>
<para>
If the object already had an association with that name,
the old association will be destroyed.
</para>

@object: object containing the associations.
@key: name of the key.
@data: data to associate with that key.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_set_data_full ##### -->
<para>
Deprecated in favor of g_object_set_data_full().
Like gtk_object_set_data() except it adds notification
for when the association is destroyed, either by
gtk_object_remove_data() or when the object is destroyed.
</para>

@object: object containing the associations.
@key: name of the key.
@data: data to associate with that key.
@destroy: function to call when the association is destroyed.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_remove_data ##### -->
<para>
Deprecated in favor of setting object data to %NULL using g_object_set_data().
Removes a specified datum from the object's data associations (the object_data).
Subsequent calls to gtk_object_get_data() will return %NULL.
</para>
<para>
If you specified a destroy handler with gtk_object_set_data_full(),
it will be invoked.
</para>

@object: the object maintaining the association.
@key: name of the key for that association.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_get_data ##### -->
<para>
Deprecated in favor of g_object_get_data().
Get a named field from the object's table of associations (the object_data).

@Returns: the data if found, or %NULL if no such data exists.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_remove_no_notify ##### -->
<para>
Deprecated in favor of g_object_steal_data().
Remove a specified datum from the object's data associations (the object_data),
without invoking the association's destroy handler.
</para>
<para>
Just like gtk_object_remove_data() except that any destroy handler
will be ignored.
Therefore this only affects data set using gtk_object_set_data_full().
</para>

@object: the object maintaining the association.
@key: name of the key for that association.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_set_user_data ##### -->
<para>
Deprecated in favor of g_object_set_data().
For convenience, every object offers a generic user data
pointer.  This function sets it.

<programlisting>
	gtk_object_set_data(object, "user_data", data);
</programlisting>
</informalexample>
</para>

@object: the object whose user data should be set.
@data: the new value for the user data.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_get_user_data ##### -->
<para>

"get_arg" handlers of the object.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_set_data_by_id ##### -->
<para>
Deprecated in favor of g_object_set_qdata().
Just like gtk_object_set_data() except that it takes
a #GQuark instead of a string, so it is slightly faster.
