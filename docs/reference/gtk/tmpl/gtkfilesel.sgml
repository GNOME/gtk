GtkFileSelection

<!-- ##### SECTION Short_Description ##### -->
prompt the user for a file or directory name.

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
<para>
#GtkFileSelection should be used to retrieve file or directory names from 
the user. It will create a new dialog window containing a directory list, 
and a file list corresponding to the current working directory. The filesystem 
can be navigated using the directory list or the drop-down history menu. 
Alternatively, the TAB key can be used to navigate using filename 
completion - common in text based editors such as emacs and jed.
</para>
<para>
File selection dialogs are created with a call to gtk_file_selection_new().
</para>
<para>
The default filename can be set using gtk_file_selection_set_filename() and the selected filename retrieved using gtk_file_selection_get_filename().
</para>
<para>
Use gtk_file_selection_complete() to display files and directories
that match a given pattern. This can be used for example, to show only
*.txt files, or only files beginning with gtk*.
</para>
<para>
Simple file operations; create directory, delete file, and rename file, are available from buttons at the top of the dialog. These can be hidden using gtk_file_selection_hide_fileop_buttons() and shown again using gtk_file_selection_show_fileop_buttons().

</para>


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_file_selection_new ##### -->
<para>
Creates a new file selection dialog box. By default it will contain a #GtkCList of the application's current working directory, and a file listing. Operation buttons that allow the user to create a directory, delete files and rename files, are also present.
</para>

@title: a message that will be placed in the file requestor's titlebar.
@Returns: the new file selection.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_file_selection_set_filename ##### -->
<para>
Sets a default path for the file requestor. If @filename includes a directory path, then the requestor will open with that path as its current working directory.

</para>

@filesel: a #GtkFileSelection.
@filename: a string to set as the default file name.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_file_selection_get_filename ##### -->
<para>
Retrieves the currently selected filename from the file selection dialog. If no file is selected then the selected directory path is returned.
</para>

@filesel: a #GtkFileSelection
@Returns: a string containing the selected file's full path.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_file_selection_complete ##### -->
<para>
Will attempt to match @pattern to a valid filenames or subdirectories in the current directory. If a match can be made, the matched filename will appear in the text entry field of the file selection dialog.
If a partial match can be made, the "Files" list will contain those
file names which have been partially matched, and the "Directories"
list those directories which have been partially matched.
</para>

@filesel: a #GtkFileSelection.
@pattern: a string of characters which may or may not match any filenames in the current directory.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_file_selection_show_fileop_buttons ##### -->
<para>
Shows the file operation buttons, if they have previously been hidden. The rest of the widgets in the dialog will be resized accordingly.
</para>

@filesel: a #GtkFileSelection.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_file_selection_hide_fileop_buttons ##### -->
<para>
Hides the file operation buttons that normally appear at the top of the dialog. Useful if you wish to create a custom file selector, based on #GtkFileSelection.
</para>

@filesel: a #GtkFileSelection.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_file_selection_get_selections ##### -->
<para>

</para>

@filesel: 
@Returns:
