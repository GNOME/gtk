<para>
GtkBox is an abstract widget which encapsulates functionallity for a
particular kind of container, one that organizes a variable number of
widgets into a rectangular area.  GtkBox currently has two derived
classes, #GtkHBox and #GtkVBox.
</para>
<para>
The rectangular area of a GtkBox is organized into either a single row
or a single column of child widgets depending upon whether the box is
of type #GtkHBox or #GtkVBox, respectively.  Thus, all children of a
GtkBox are allocated one dimension in common, which is the height of a
row, or the width of a column.
</para>
<para>
GtkBox uses a notion of <emphasis>packing</emphasis>.  Packing refers to
adding widgets with reference to a particular position in a
#GtkContainer.  For a GtkBox, there are two reference positions: the
<emphasis>start</emphasis> and the <emphasis>end</emphasis> of the box.  For a
#GtkVBox, the start is defined as the top of the box and the end is
defined as the bottom.  For a #GtkHBox the start is defined as the
left side and the end is defined as the right side.
</para>
<para>
Use repeated calls to gtk_box_pack_start() to pack widgets into a
GtkBox from start to end.  Use gtk_box_pack_end() to add widgets from
end to start.  You may intersperse these calls and add widgets from
both ends of the same GtkBox.
</para>
<para>
Use gtk_box_pack_start_defaults() or gtk_box_pack_end_defaults()
to pack widgets into a GtkBox if you do not need to specify the
<structfield>expand</structfield>, <structfield>fill</structfield>, or
<structfield>padding</structfield> attributes of the child to be
added.
</para>
<para>
Because GtkBox is a #GtkContainer, you may also use
gtk_container_add() to insert widgets into the box, and they will be
packed as if with gtk_box_pack_start_defaults().  Use
gtk_container_remove() to remove widgets from the GtkBox.
</para>
<para>
Use gtk_box_set_homogeneous() to specify whether or not all children
of the GtkBox are forced to get the same amount of space.
</para>
<para>
Use gtk_box_set_spacing() to determine how much space will be
minimally placed between all children in the GtkBox.
</para>
<para>
Use gtk_box_reorder_child() to move a GtkBox child to a different
place in the box.
</para>
<para>
Use gtk_box_set_child_packing() to reset the
<structfield>expand</structfield>, <structfield>fill</structfield>,
and <structfield>padding</structfield> attributes of any GtkBox child.
Use gtk_box_query_child_packing() to query these fields.

The #GtkBoxChild-struct holds a child widget of GtkBox and describes

and reset the <structfield>padding</structfield>,

<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_box_pack_start ##### -->
<para>
Adds @child to @box, packed with reference to the start of @box.  The
@child is packed after any other child packed with reference to the
start of @box.
</para>

@box: a #GtkBox.
@child: the #GtkWidget to be added to @box.
@expand: %TRUE if the new child is to be given extra space allocated to
@box.  The extra space will be divided evenly between all children of
@box that use this option.
@fill: %TRUE if space given to @child by the @expand option is
actually allocated to @child, rather than just padding it.  This
parameter has no effect if @expand is set to %FALSE.  A child is
always allocated the full height of a #GtkHBox and the full width of a
#GtkVBox.  This option affects the other dimension.
@padding: extra space in pixels to put between this child and its
neighbors, over and above the global amount specified by
<structfield>spacing</structfield> in #GtkBox-struct.  If @child is a
widget at one of the reference ends of @box, then @padding pixels are also put
between @child and the reference edge of @box.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_box_pack_end ##### -->
<para>
Adds @child to @box, packed with reference to the end of @box.  The
@child is packed after (away from end of) any other child packed with reference to the
end of @box.
</para>

@box: a #GtkBox.
@child: the #GtkWidget to be added to @box.
@expand: %TRUE if the new child is to be given extra space allocated to
@box.  The extra space will be divided evenly between all children of
@box that use this option.
@fill: %TRUE if space given to @child by the @expand option is
actually allocated to @child, rather than just padding it.  This
parameter has no effect if @expand is set to %FALSE.  A child is
always allocated the full height of a #GtkHBox and the full width of a
#GtkVBox.  This option affects the other dimension.
@padding: extra space in pixels to put between this child and its
neighbors, over and above the global amount specified by
<structfield>spacing</structfield> in #GtkBox-struct.  If @child is a
widget at one of the reference ends of @box, then @padding pixels are also put
between @child and the reference edge of @box.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_box_pack_start_defaults ##### -->
<para>
Adds @widget to @box, packed with reference to the start of @box.  The
child is packed after any other child packed with reference to the
start of @box.
</para>
<para>
Parameters for how to pack the child @widget,
<structfield>expand</structfield>, <structfield>fill</structfield>,
and <structfield>padding</structfield> in #GtkBoxChild-struct, are given their default
values, %TRUE, %TRUE, and 0, respectively.
</para>

@box: a #GtkBox.
@widget: the #GtkWidget to be added to @box.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_box_pack_end_defaults ##### -->
<para>
Adds @widget to @box, packed with reference to the end of @box.  The
child is packed after (away from end of) any other child packed with
reference to the end of @box.
</para>
<para>
Parameters for how to pack the child @widget,
<structfield>expand</structfield>, <structfield>fill</structfield>,
and <structfield>padding</structfield> in #GtkBoxChild-struct, are given their default
values, %TRUE, %TRUE, and 0, respectively.

@widget: the #GtkWidget to be added to @box.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_box_get_homogeneous ##### -->
<para>

</para>

@box: 
@Returns: 


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_box_set_homogeneous ##### -->
<para>
Sets the <structfield>homogeneous</structfield> field of
#GtkBox-struct, controlling whether or not all children of @box are
given equal space in the box.
</para>

@box: a #GtkBox.
@homogeneous: a boolean value, %TRUE to create equal allotments,
%FALSE for variable allotments.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_box_get_spacing ##### -->
<para>

</para>

@box: 
@Returns: 


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_box_set_spacing ##### -->
<para>
Sets the <structfield>spacing</structfield> field of #GtkBox-struct,
which is the number of pixels to place between children of @box.
</para>

@box: a #GtkBox.
@spacing: the number of pixels to put between children.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_box_reorder_child ##### -->
<para>
Moves @child to a new @position in the list of @box children.  The
list is the <structfield>children</structfield> field of
#GtkBox-struct, and contains both widgets packed #GTK_PACK_START as
well as widgets packed #GTK_PACK_END, in the order that these widgets
were added to @box.
</para>
<para>
A widget's position in the @box children list determines where the
widget is packed into @box.  A child widget at some position in the
list will be packed just after all other widgets of the same packing
type that appear earlier in the list.
</para>

@box: a #GtkBox.
@child: the #GtkWidget to move.
@position: the new position for @child in the
<structfield>children</structfield> list of #GtkBox-struct, starting
from 0. If negative, indicates the end of the list.
