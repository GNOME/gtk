    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>
      To create a tree or list in GTK+, use the #GtkTreeModel interface in
      conjunction with the #GtkTreeView widget.  This widget is
      designed around a <firstterm>Model/View/Controller</firstterm>
      design and consists of four major parts:
      <simplelist>
	<member>The tree view widget (<structname>GtkTreeView</structname>)</member>
	<member>The view column (<structname>GtkTreeViewColumn</structname>)</member>
	<member>The cell renderers (<structname>GtkCellRenderer</structname> etc.)</member>
	<member>The model interface (<structname>GtkTreeModel</structname>)</member>
      </simplelist>
      The <emphasis>View</emphasis> is composed of the first three
	objects, while the last is the <emphasis>Model</emphasis>.  One
	of the prime benefits of the MVC design is that multiple views
	can be created of a single model.  For example, a model mapping
	the file system could be created for a file manager.  Many views
	could be created to display various parts of the file system,
	but only one copy need be kept in memory.
    </para>
    <para>
        The purpose of the cell renderers is to provide extensibility to the
        widget and to allow multiple ways of rendering the same type of data.
        For example, consider how to render a boolean variable.  Should it
        render it as a string of "True" or "False", "On" or "Off", or should
        it be rendered as a checkbox?

    <title>Creating a model</title>
    <para>
      GTK+ provides two simple models that can be used: the #GtkListStore
      and the #GtkTreeStore.  GtkListStore is used to model list widgets, 
      while the GtkTreeStore models trees.  It is possible to develop a new 
      type of model, but the existing models should be satisfactory for all 
      but the most specialized of situations.  Creating the model is quite 
      simple:
    </para>
      <informalexample><programlisting><![CDATA[
GtkListStore *store = gtk_list_store_new (2, G_TYPE_STRING, G_TYPE_BOOLEAN);
]]></programlisting></informalexample>
    <para>
      This creates a list store with two columns: a string column and a boolean
      column.  Typically the 2 is never passed directly like that; usually an
      enum is created wherein the different columns are enumerated, followed by
      a token that represents the total number of columns.  The next example will
      illustrate this, only using a tree store instead of a list store. Creating
      a tree store operates almost exactly the same.
    </para>
    <informalexample><programlisting><![CDATA[
enum
{
   TITLE_COLUMN,
   AUTHOR_COLUMN,
   CHECKED_COLUMN,
   N_COLUMNS
};

GtkTreeStore *store = gtk_tree_store_new (N_COLUMNS,       /* Total number of columns */
                                          G_TYPE_STRING,   /* Book title              */
                                          G_TYPE_STRING,   /* Author                  */
                                          G_TYPE_BOOLEAN); /* Is checked out?         */
]]></programlisting></informalexample>
    <para>
      Adding data to the model is done using gtk_tree_store_set() or 
      gtk_list_store_set(), depending upon which sort of model was
      created.  To do this, a #GtkTreeIter must be acquired.  The iterator 
      points to the location where data will be added.
    </para>
    <para>
      Once an iterator has been acquired, gtk_tree_store_set() is used to
      apply data to the part of the model that the iterator points to.  
      Consider the following example:
    </para>
    <informalexample><programlisting><![CDATA[
GtkTreeIter   iter;

gtk_tree_store_append (store, &iter, NULL);  /* Acquire an iterator */

gtk_tree_store_set (store, &iter,
                    TITLE_COLUMN, "The Principle of Reason",
                    AUTHOR_COLUMN, "Martin Heidegger",
                    CHECKED_COLUMN, FALSE,
                    -1);
]]></programlisting></informalexample>

  <para>
    Notice that the last argument is -1.  This is always done because
    this is a variable-argument function and it needs to know when to stop
    processing arguments.  It can be used to set the data in any or all
    columns in a given row.
  </para>
  <para>
    The third argument to gtk_tree_store_append() is the parent iterator.  It
    is used to add a row to a GtkTreeStore as a child of an existing row.  This
    means that the new row will only be visible when its parent is visible and
    in its expanded state.  Consider the following example:
  </para>
  <informalexample><programlisting><![CDATA[
GtkTreeIter iter1;  /* Parent iter */
GtkTreeIter iter2;  /* Child iter  */

gtk_tree_store_append (store, &iter1, NULL);  /* Acquire a top-level iterator */
gtk_tree_store_set (store, &iter1,
                    TITLE_COLUMN, "The Art of Computer Programming",
                    AUTHOR_COLUMN, "Donald E. Knuth",
                    CHECKED_COLUMN, FALSE,
                    -1);

gtk_tree_store_append (store, &iter2, &iter1);  /* Acquire a child iterator */
gtk_tree_store_set (store, &iter2,
                    TITLE_COLUMN, "Volume 1: Fundamental Algorithms",
                    -1);

gtk_tree_store_append (store, &iter2, &iter1);
gtk_tree_store_set (store, &iter2,
                    TITLE_COLUMN, "Volume 2: Seminumerical Algorithms",
                    -1);

gtk_tree_store_append (store, &iter2, &iter1);
gtk_tree_store_set (store, &iter2,
                    TITLE_COLUMN, "Volume 3: Sorting and Searching",
                    -1);

    <title>Creating the view component</title>
    <para>
      While there are several different models to choose from, there is
      only one view widget to deal with.  It works with either the list
      or the tree store.  Setting up a #GtkTreeView is not a difficult
      matter.  It needs a #GtkTreeModel to know where to retrieve its data 
      from.
    </para>
    <informalexample><programlisting><![CDATA[
GtkWidget *tree;

tree = gtk_tree_view_new_with_model (GTK_TREE_MODEL (store));
]]></programlisting></informalexample>

    <refsect2>
      <title>Columns and cell renderers</title>
      <para>
	Once the #GtkTreeView widget has a model, it will need to know how 
        to display the model.  It does this with columns and cell renderers.
      </para>
      <para>
        Cell renderers are used to draw the data in the tree model in a
        way.  There are a number of cell renderers that come with GTK+,
        including the #GtkCellRendererText, #GtkCellRendererPixbuf and
        the #GtkCellRendererToggle.
        It is relatively easy to write a custom renderer.
      </para>
      <para>
        A #GtkTreeViewColumn is the object that GtkTreeView uses to organize 
        the vertical columns in the tree view.  It needs to know the name of 
        the column to label for the user, what type of cell renderer to use, 
        and which piece of data to retrieve from the model for a given row.
      </para>
      <informalexample><programlisting>
GtkCellRenderer *renderer;
GtkTreeViewColumn *column;

renderer = gtk_cell_renderer_text_new (<!-- -->);
column = gtk_tree_view_column_new_with_attributes ("Author",
                                                   renderer,
                                                   "text", AUTHOR_COLUMN,
                                                   NULL);
gtk_tree_view_append_column (GTK_TREE_VIEW (tree), column);
</programlisting></informalexample>
      <para>
       At this point, all the steps in creating a displayable tree have been
       covered.  The model is created, data is stored in it, a tree view is
       created and columns are added to it.
      </para>
    </refsect2>

    <refsect2>
      <title>Selection handling</title>
      <para>
        Most applications will need to not only deal with displaying data, but 
        also receiving input events from users.  To do this, simply get a 
        reference to a selection object and connect to the 
        #GtkTreeSelection::changed signal.
      </para>
      <informalexample><programlisting><![CDATA[
/* Prototype for selection handler callback */
static void tree_selection_changed_cb (GtkTreeSelection *selection, gpointer data);

/* Setup the selection handler */
GtkTreeSelection *select;

select = gtk_tree_view_get_selection (GTK_TREE_VIEW (tree));
gtk_tree_selection_set_mode (select, GTK_SELECTION_SINGLE);
g_signal_connect (G_OBJECT (select), "changed",
                  G_CALLBACK (tree_selection_changed_cb),

        if (gtk_tree_selection_get_selected (selection, &model, &iter))
        {
                gtk_tree_model_get (model, &iter, AUTHOR_COLUMN, &author, -1);

                g_print ("You selected a book by %s\n", author);

    <title>Simple Example</title>
    <para>
      Here is a simple example of using a #GtkTreeView widget in context 
      of the other widgets.  It simply creates a simple model and view, 
      and puts them together.  Note that the model is never populated 
      with data &mdash; that is left as an exercise for the reader.  
      More information can be found on this in the #GtkTreeModel section.
