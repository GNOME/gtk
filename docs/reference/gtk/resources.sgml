<title>Opening a bug or feature request</title>

<para>
If you encounter a bug, misfeature, or missing feature in GTK, please
file a bug report on our
<ulink url="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/issues/new">GitLab project</ulink>.
You should also file issues if the documentation is out of date with the
existing API, or unclear.
</para>

<para>
Don't hesitate to file a bug report, even if you think we may know
about it already, or aren't sure of the details. Just give us as much
information as you have, and if it's already fixed or has already been
discussed, we'll add a note to that effect in the report.
</para>

<para>
The bug tracker should definitely be used for feature requests, it's
not only for bugs. We track all GTK development in GitLab, to ensure
that nothing gets lost.

<title>Working on GTK</title>

<para>
If you develop a bugfix or enhancement for GTK, please open a merge
request in GitLab as well. You should not attach patches to an issue,
or describe the fix as a comment. Merge requests allow us to build
GTK with your code applied, and run the test suite, on multiple platforms
and architectures, and verify that nothing breaks. They also allow us to
do proper code reviews, so we can iterate over the changes.
</para>

<para>
You should follow the <ulink url="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">contribution guide</ulink>
for GTK, available on GitLab.
</para>

<para>
If you want to discuss your approach before or after working on it,
send and email to <ulink url="mailto:gtk-devel-list@gnome.org">gtk-devel-list@gnome.org</ulink>.
You should not send a patch to the mailing list, as it will inevitably
get lost, or forgotten. Always open a merge request.
</para>

<title>Mailing lists</title>

<para>
There are several mailing lists dedicated to GTK and related
libraries. Discussion of GLib, Pango, and ATK in addition to GTK
proper is welcome on these lists. You can subscribe or view the
archives of these lists on 
<ulink url="https://mail.gnome.org">http://mail.gnome.org</ulink>.
If you aren't subscribed to the list, any message you post to
the list will be held for manual moderation, which might take
some days to happen.

<listitem><para>
gtk-list covers general GTK topics; questions about using GTK in programs,
GTK from a user standpoint, announcements of GTK-related projects
such as themes or GTK modules would all be on-topic. The bulk of the
traffic consists of GTK programming questions.

gtk-app-devel-list covers writing applications in GTK. It's narrower
in scope than gtk-list, but the two lists overlap quite a
bit. gtk-app-devel-list is a good place to ask questions about GTK
programming.  </para></listitem>
