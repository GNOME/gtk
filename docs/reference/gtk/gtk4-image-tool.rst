DESCRIPTION

``gtk4-image-tool`` can perform various operations on images.

COMMANDS
--------

Information
^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``info`` command shows general information about the image, such
as its format and color state.

Showing
^^^^^^^

The ``show`` command displays one or more images, side-by-side.

``--undecorated``

  Removes window decorations. This is meant for rendering of exactly the
  image without any titlebar.

Playing
^^^^^^^

The ``play`` command plays one or more SVG animations, side-by-side.
Clicking on the animation will change the state of the GtkSvg paintable,
where applicable.

``--undecorated``

  Removes window decorations. This is meant for rendering of exactly the
  animation without any titlebar.

``--size=SIZE``

  Show the animation at the given size.

Compare
^^^^^^^

The ``compare`` command compares two images. If any differences are found,
the exit code is 1. If the images are identical, it is 0.

``--output=FILE``

  Save the differences as a png image in ``FILE``.

``--quiet``

  Don't write results to stdout.

Conversion
^^^^^^^^^^

The ``convert`` command converts the image to a different format or color state.
The format of the output file is determined from the filename extension.

``--format=FORMAT``

  Convert to the given format. The supported formats can be listed
  with ``--format=list``.

``--color-state=COLORSTATE``

  Convert to the given color state. The supported color states can be
  listed with ``--format=list``.

``--cicp=CICP``

  Convert to a color state that is specified as a cicp tuple. The cicp tuple
  must be specified as four numbers, separated by /, e.g. 1/13/6/0.

Relabeling
^^^^^^^^^^

The ``relabel`` command changes the color state of an image without conversion.
The format of the output file is determined from the filename extension.

This can be useful to produce wrong color renderings for diagnostics.

``--color-state=COLORSTATE``

  Relabel to the given color state. The supported color states can be
  listed with ``--format=list``.

``--cicp=CICP``

  Relabel to a color state that is specified as a cicp tuple. The cicp tuple
  must be specified as four numbers, separated by /, e.g. 1/13/6/0.
