  <title>Migrating from SexyUrlLabel to GtkLabel</title>

  <para>
    GTK+ 2.18 supports showing links inside a #GtkLabel, similar to
    SexyUrlLabel. Porting from SexyUrlLabel to GtkLabel is relatively
    straightforward. GtkLabel accepts links in the markup using the
    same HTML <tag>a</tag> notation that SexyUrlLabel uses. In addition
    to the href attribute, GtkLabel accepts a title attribute that
    is displayed as a tooltip on the link. Instead of
    sexy_url_label_set_markup(), just call gtk_label_set_markup().
  </para>
  <para>
    One difference between the two APIs is that the ::url-activated signal
    from SexyUrlLabel has been replaced by the #GtkLabel::activate-link
    signal. The need for connecting to this signal is greatly reduced,
    since GtkLabel has a default handler that calls gtk_show_uri().
