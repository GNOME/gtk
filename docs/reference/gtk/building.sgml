    <title>Building GTK+ on UNIX-like systems</title>
    <para>
      This chapter covers building and installing GTK+ on UNIX and
      UNIX-like systems such as Linux. Compiling GTK+ on Microsoft
      Windows is different in detail and somewhat more difficult to
      get going since the necessary tools aren't included with
      the operating system.
    </para>
    <para>
      Before we get into the details of how to compile GTK+, we should
      mention that in many cases, binary packages of GTK+ prebuilt for
      your operating system will be available, either from your
      operating system vendor or from independent sources. If such a
      set of packages is available, installing it will get you
      programming with GTK+ much faster than building it yourself. In
      fact, you may well already have GTK+ installed on your system
      already.
    </para>
    <para>
      On UNIX-like systems GTK+ uses the standard GNU build system,
      using <application>autoconf</application> for package
      configuration and resolving portability issues,
      <application>automake</application> for building makefiles that
      comply with the GNU Coding Standards, and
      <application>libtool</application> for building shared libraries
      on multiple platforms.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you are building GTK+ from the distributed source packages,
      then you won't need these tools installed; the necessary pieces
      of the tools are already included in the source packages. But
      it's useful to know a bit about how packages that use these
      tools work. A source package is distributed as a
      <literal>tar.bz2</literal> or <literal>tar.xz</literal> file
      which you unpack into a directory full of the source files as follows:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
      tar xvfj gtk+-3.2.0.tar.bz2
      tar xvfJ gtk+-3.2.0.tar.xz
    </programlisting>
    <para>
      In the toplevel directory that is created, there will be
      a shell script called <filename>configure</filename> which
      you then run to take the template makefiles called
      <filename>Makefile.in</filename> in the package and create
      makefiles customized for your operating system.
      The <filename>configure</filename> script can be passed
      various command line arguments to determine how the package
      is built and installed. The most commonly useful argument is
      the <systemitem>--prefix</systemitem> argument which
      determines where the package is installed. To install a package
      in <filename>/opt/gtk</filename> you would run configure as:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
      ./configure --prefix=/opt/gtk
    </programlisting>
    <para>
      A full list of options can be found by running
      <filename>configure</filename> with the
      <systemitem>--help</systemitem> argument. In general, the defaults are
      right and should be trusted. After you've run
      <filename>configure</filename>, you then run the
      <command>make</command> command to build the package and install
      it.
    </para>
    <programlisting>
      make
      make install
    </programlisting>
    <para>
      If you don't have permission to write to the directory you are
      installing in, you may have to change to root temporarily before
      running <literal>make install</literal>. Also, if you are
      installing in a system directory, on some systems (such as
      Linux), you will need to run <command>ldconfig</command> after
      <literal>make install</literal> so that the newly installed
      libraries will be found.
    </para>
    <para>
      Several environment variables are useful to pass to set before
      running configure. <envar>CPPFLAGS</envar> contains options to
      pass to the C compiler, and is used to tell the compiler where
      to look for include files. The <envar>LDFLAGS</envar> variable
      is used in a similar fashion for the linker. Finally the
      <envar>PKG_CONFIG_PATH</envar> environment variable contains
      a search path that <command>pkg-config</command> (see below)
      uses when looking for files describing how to compile
      programs using different libraries. If you were installing GTK+
      and it's dependencies into <filename>/opt/gtk</filename>, you
      might want to set these variables as:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
      CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/gtk/include"
      LDFLAGS="-L/opt/gtk/lib"
      PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/gtk/lib/pkgconfig"
      export CPPFLAGS LDFLAGS PKG_CONFIG_PATH
    </programlisting>
    <para>
      You may also need to set the <envar>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</envar>
      environment variable so the systems dynamic linker can find
      the newly installed libraries, and the <envar>PATH</envar>
      environment program so that utility binaries installed by
      the various libraries will be found.
    </para>
    <programlisting>
      LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/gtk/lib"
      PATH="/opt/gtk/bin:$PATH"
      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH PATH
    </programlisting>

      Before you can compile the GTK+ widget toolkit, you need to have
      various other tools and libraries installed on your
      system. The two tools needed during the build process (as
      differentiated from the tools used in when creating GTK+
      mentioned above such as <application>autoconf</application>)
      are <command>pkg-config</command> and GNU make.

          is a tool for tracking the compilation flags needed for
          libraries that are used by the GTK+ libraries. (For each
          library, a small <literal>.pc</literal> text file is installed
          in a standard location that contains the compilation flags
          needed for that library along with version number information.)

          The GTK+ makefiles will mostly work with different versions
          of <command>make</command>, however, there tends to be

          installing <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/software/make">GNU
            make</ulink> if you don't already have it on your system

      First make sure that you have the necessary external
      dependencies installed: <command>pkg-config</command>, GNU make,
      the JPEG, PNG, and TIFF libraries, FreeType, and, if necessary,
      libiconv and libintl. To get detailed information about building
      these packages, see the documentation provided with the
      individual packages.
      On a Linux system, it's quite likely you'll have all of these
      installed already except for <command>pkg-config</command>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Then build and install the GTK+ libraries in the order:
      GLib, Pango, ATK, then GTK+. For each library, follow the
      steps of <literal>configure</literal>, <literal>make</literal>,
      <literal>make install</literal> mentioned above. If you're
      lucky, this will all go smoothly, and you'll be ready to
      <link linkend="gtk-compiling">start compiling your own GTK+

      by running the <command>gtk3-demo</command> program that

      If one of the <filename>configure</filename> scripts fails or running

      Looking at the last couple of hundred lines in this file will
      frequently make clear what went wrong. If all else fails, you

          Normally GTK+ will try to build the input method modules
          as little shared libraries that are loaded on demand.
          The <systemitem>--disable-modules</systemitem> argument
          indicates that they should all be built statically
          into the GTK+ library instead. This is useful for
          people who need to produce statically-linked binaries.
          If neither <systemitem>--disable-modules</systemitem> nor
          <systemitem>--enable-modules</systemitem> is specified,
          then the <command>configure</command> script will try to
          auto-detect whether shared modules work on your system.

         This option allows you to specify which input method modules you

        <para>
         Turns on various amounts of debugging support. Setting this to
         'no' disables g_assert(), g_return_if_fail(), g_return_val_if_fail()           and all cast checks between different object types. Setting it
         to 'minimum' disables only cast checks. Setting it to 'yes' enables
         <link linkend="GTK-Debug-Options">runtime debugging</link>.
         The default is 'minimum'.
         Note that 'no' is fast, but dangerous as it tends to destabilize
         even mostly bug-free software by changing the effect of many bugs
         from simple warnings into fatal crashes. Thus

        <para>
          The option <systemitem>--disable-Bsymbolic</systemitem>
          turns off the use of the -Bsymbolic-functions linker flag.
          This is only necessary if you want to override GTK+ functions
          by using <envar>LD_PRELOAD</envar>.

      <formalpara>
        <title><systemitem>--enable-explicit-deps</systemitem> and
          <systemitem>--disable-explicit-deps</systemitem></title>
        <para>
          If <systemitem>--enable-explicit-deps</systemitem> is
          specified then GTK+ will write the full set of libraries
          that GTK+ depends upon into its <literal>.pc</literal> files to be used when
          programs depending on GTK+ are linked. Otherwise, GTK+
          only will include the GTK+ libraries themselves, and
          will depend on system library dependency facilities to
          bring in the other libraries.
          By default GTK+ will disable explicit dependencies unless
          it detects that they are needed on the system. (If you
          specify <systemitem>--enable-static</systemitem> to force
          building of static libraries, then explicit dependencies
          will be written since library dependencies don't work
          for static libraries.) Specifying
          <systemitem>--enable-explicit-deps</systemitem> or
          <systemitem>--enable-static</systemitem> can cause
          compatibility
          problems when libraries that GTK+ depends upon change
          their versions, and should be avoided if possible.

        <para>
          By default the <command>configure</command> script will try
          to auto-detect whether the XKB extension is supported by
          the X libraries GTK+ is linked with.
          These options can be used to explicitly control whether
          GTK+ will support the XKB extension.

        <title><systemitem>--disable-xinput</systemitem> and

        <para>
          Controls whether GTK+ is built with support for the XInput
          or XInput2 extension. These extensions provide an extended
          interface to input devices such as graphics tablets.
          When this support is compiled in, specially written
          GTK+ programs can get access to subpixel positions,
          multiple simultaneous input devices, and extra "axes"
          provided by the device such as pressure and tilt
          information.

          The <application>gtk-doc</application> package is
          used to generate the reference documentation included
          with GTK+. By default support for <application>gtk-doc</application>
          is disabled because it requires various extra dependencies
          to be installed. If you have
          <application>gtk-doc</application> installed and
          are modifying GTK+, you may want to enable
          <application>gtk-doc</application> support by passing
          in <systemitem>--enable-gtk-doc</systemitem>. If not
          enabled, pre-generated HTML files distributed with GTK+
          will be installed.

          Enables specific backends for GDK.  If none of these options
          are given, the x11 backend will be enabled by default,
          unless the platform is Windows, in which case the default is
          win32.  If any backend is explicitly enabled or disabled, no
          other platform will be enabled automatically.  Other
          supported backends are the quartz backend for OS X.
