    <title>Building GTK+</title>
    <para>
      Before we get into the details of how to compile GTK+, we should
      mention that in many cases, binary packages of GTK+ prebuilt for
      your operating system will be available, either from your
      operating system vendor or from independent sources. If such a
      set of packages is available, installing it will get you
      programming with GTK+ much faster than building it yourself. In
      fact, you may well already have GTK+ installed on your system
      already.
    </para>
    <para>
      In order to build GTK+, you will need <application>meson</application>
      installed on your system. On Linux, and other UNIX-like operating
      systems, you will also need <application>ninja</application>. This
      guide does not cover how to install these two requirements, but you
      can refer to the <ulink url="http://mesonbuild.com">Meson website</ulink>
      for more information. The <ulink url="https://ninja-build.org">Ninja</ulink>
      build tool is also usable on various operating systems, so we will
      refer to it in the examples.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you are building GTK+ from a source distribution or from a Git
      clone, you will need to use <application>meson</application> to
      configure the project. The most commonly useful argument is the
      <systemitem>--prefix</systemitem> one, which determines where the
      files will go once installed. To install GTK+ under a prefix
      like <filename>/opt/gtk</filename> you would run Meson as:
    </para>
    <informalexample>
      <programlisting>
        meson --prefix /opt/gtk builddir
      </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
    <para>
      Meson will create the <filename>builddir</filename> directory and
      place all the build artefacts there.
    </para>
    <para>
      You can get a list of all available options for the build by
      running <application>meson configure</application>.
    </para>
    <para>
      After Meson successfully configured the build directory, you then
      can run the build, using Ninja:
    </para>
    <informalexample>
      <programlisting>
        cd builddir
        ninja
        ninja install
      </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
    <para>
      If you don't have permission to write to the directory you are
      installing in, you may have to change to root temporarily before
      running <literal>ninja install</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Several environment variables are useful to pass to set before
      running configure. <envar>CPPFLAGS</envar> contains options to
      pass to the C compiler, and is used to tell the compiler where
      to look for include files. The <envar>LDFLAGS</envar> variable
      is used in a similar fashion for the linker. Finally the
      <envar>PKG_CONFIG_PATH</envar> environment variable contains
      a search path that <command>pkg-config</command> (see below)
      uses when looking for files describing how to compile
      programs using different libraries. If you were installing GTK+
      and it's dependencies into <filename>/opt/gtk</filename>, you
      might want to set these variables as:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
      CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/gtk/include"
      LDFLAGS="-L/opt/gtk/lib"
      PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/gtk/lib/pkgconfig"
      export CPPFLAGS LDFLAGS PKG_CONFIG_PATH
    </programlisting>
    <para>
      You may also need to set the <envar>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</envar>
      environment variable so the systems dynamic linker can find
      the newly installed libraries, and the <envar>PATH</envar>
      environment program so that utility binaries installed by
      the various libraries will be found.
    </para>
    <programlisting>
      LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/gtk/lib"
      PATH="/opt/gtk/bin:$PATH"
      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH PATH
    </programlisting>
  </refsect1>

    <title>Dependencies</title>
    <para>
      Before you can compile the GTK+ widget toolkit, you need to have
      various other tools and libraries installed on your
      system. Dependencies of GTK+ have their own build systems, so
      you will need to refer to their own installation instructions.
    </para>
    <para>
      A particular important tool used by GTK+ to find its dependencies
      is <application>pkg-config</application>.
    </para>
    <para>
      <ulink url="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/">pkg-config</ulink>
      is a tool for tracking the compilation flags needed for
      libraries that are used by the GTK+ libraries. (For each
      library, a small <literal>.pc</literal> text file is installed
      in a standard location that contains the compilation flags
      needed for that library along with version number information.)
    </para>
    <para>
      Some of the libraries that GTK+ depends on are maintained by
      by the GTK+ team: GLib, GdkPixbuf, Pango, ATK and GObject Introspection.
      Other libraries are maintained separately.

          gdk-pixbuf will use GIO for mime type detection if possible. For this

      First make sure that you have the necessary external
      dependencies installed: <command>pkg-config</command>, Meson, Ninja,
      the JPEG, PNG, and TIFF libraries, FreeType, and, if necessary,
      libiconv and libintl. To get detailed information about building
      these packages, see the documentation provided with the
      individual packages. On any average Linux system, it's quite likely
      you'll have all of these installed already, or they will be easily
      accessible through your operating system package repositories.
    </para>
    <para>
      Then build and install the GTK+ libraries in the order:
      GLib, Cairo, Pango, ATK, then GTK+. For each library, follow the
      instructions they provide, and make sure to share common settings
      between them and the GTK+ build; if you are using a separate prefix
      for GTK+, for instance, you will need to use the same prefix for all
      its dependencies you build. If you're lucky, this will all go smoothly,
      and you'll be ready to <link linkend="gtk-compiling">start compiling
      your own GTK+ applications</link>. You can test your GTK+ installation
      by running the <command>gtk4-demo</command> program that
      GTK+ installs.
    </para>
    <para>
      If one of the projects you're configuring or building fails, look
      closely at the error messages printed; these will often provide useful
      information as to what went wrong. Every build system has its own
      log that can help you understand the issue you're encountering. If all
      else fails, you can ask for help on the gtk-list mailing list.

        <title><systemitem>disable-modules</systemitem></title>

        <para>
          Normally GTK+ will try to build the input method modules
          as little shared libraries that are loaded on demand.
          The <systemitem>disable-modules</systemitem> option
          indicates that they should all be built statically
          into the GTK+ library instead. This is useful for
          people who need to produce statically-linked binaries.
          If <systemitem>disable-modules</systemitem> is not specified,
          then the <command>configure</command> script will try to
          auto-detect whether shared modules work on your system.

      <formalpara>
        <title><systemitem>with-included-immodules</systemitem></title>

        <para>
         This option allows you to specify which input method modules you

        <title><systemitem>enable-xinerama</systemitem></title>

        <para>
          By default GTK+ will try to link against the Xinerama libraries
          if they are found. This options can be used to explicitly control
          whether Xinerama should be used.

          The <application>gtk-doc</application> package is
          used to generate the reference documentation included
          with GTK+. By default support for <application>gtk-doc</application>
          is disabled because it requires various extra dependencies
          to be installed. If you have
          <application>gtk-doc</application> installed and
          are modifying GTK+, you may want to enable
          <application>gtk-doc</application> support by passing

        </para>
        <para>
          Additionally, some tools provided by GTK+ have their own
          manual pages generated using a similar set of dependencies;
          if you have <application>xsltproc</application> then you
          can generate manual pages by passing <systemitem>enable-man-pages</systemitem>
          when configuring the build.

        <para>
          By default, GTK+ will try to build various print backends if

          or not.

        <para>
          Enable specific backends for GDK.  If none of these options
          are given, the Wayland backend will be enabled by default,
          if the platform is Linux; the X11 backend will also be enabled
          by default, unless the platform is Windows, in which case the
          default is win32, or the platform is macOS, in which case the
          default is quartz. If any backend is explicitly enabled or disabled,
          no other platform will be enabled automatically.
