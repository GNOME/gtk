<answer><para>
The GTK+ <ulink url="http://www.gtk.org">website</ulink> offers some
<ulink url="http://www.gtk.org/documentation">tutorials</ulink> and other
documentation (most of it about GTK+ 2.x, but mostly still applicable).
More documentation ranging from whitepapers to online books can be found at
the <ulink url="http://developer.gnome.org">GNOME developer's site</ulink>.
After studying these materials you should be well prepared to come back to

<question><para>
How does memory management work in GTK+? Should I free data returned
from functions?
</para></question>

<answer>

<para>
See the documentation for #GObject and #GInitiallyUnowned. For #GObject note
specifically g_object_ref() and g_object_unref(). #GInitiallyUnowned is a
subclass of #GObject so the same points apply, except that it has a "floating"
state (explained in its documentation).
</para>

<para>
For strings returned from functions, they will be declared "const"
if they should not be freed. Non-const strings should be
freed with g_free(). Arrays follow the same rule. If you find an
undocumented exception to the rules, please report a bug to <ulink
url="http://bugzilla.gnome.org">http://bugzilla.gnome.org</ulink>.

<question>
<para>
Why does my program leak memory, if I destroy a widget immediately
after creating it ?
</para>
</question>

<answer>
<para>
If <structname>GtkFoo</structname> isn't a toplevel window, then
<informalexample><programlisting>
 foo = gtk_foo_new (<!-- -->);
 gtk_widget_destroy (foo);
</programlisting></informalexample>
is a memory leak, because no one assumed the initial floating
reference. If you are using a widget and you aren't immediately
packing it into a container, then you probably want standard
reference counting, not floating reference counting.
</para>

<para>
To to get this, you must acquire a reference to the widget and drop the
floating reference (<quote>ref and sink</quote> in GTK+ parlance) after
creating it:
<informalexample><programlisting>
 foo = gtk_foo_new (<!-- -->);
 g_object_ref_sink (foo);
</programlisting></informalexample>
When you want to get rid of the widget, you must call gtk_widget_destroy()
to break any external connections to the widget before dropping your
reference:
<informalexample><programlisting>
 gtk_widget_destroy (foo);
 g_object_unref (foo);
</programlisting></informalexample>
When you immediately add a widget to a container, it takes care of
assuming the initial floating reference and you don't have to worry
about reference counting at all ... just call gtk_widget_destroy()
to get rid of the widget.

<question><para>
How do I internationalize a GTK+ program?
</para></question>

<answer>
<para>
Most people use <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/">GNU
gettext</ulink>, already required in order to install GLib. On a UNIX
or Linux system with gettext installed, type <literal>info gettext</literal>
to read the documentation.
</para>
<para>
The short checklist on how to use gettext is: call bindtextdomain() so
gettext can find the files containing your translations, call textdomain()
to set the default translation domain, call bind_textdomain_codeset() to
request that all translated strings are returned in UTF-8, then call
gettext() to look up each string to be translated in the default domain.
</para>
<para>
<filename>gi18n.h</filename> provides the following shorthand macros for
convenience.
Conventionally, people define macros as follows for convenience:
<informalexample>
<programlisting>
  #define  _(x)     gettext (x)
  #define N_(x)     x
  #define C_(ctx,x) pgettext (ctx, x)
</programlisting>
</informalexample>
You use N_() (N stands for no-op) to mark a string for translation in
a location where a function call to gettext() is not allowed, such as
in an array initializer.
You eventually have to call gettext() on the string to actually fetch
the translation. _() both marks the string for translation and actually
translates it.
The C_() macro (C stands for context) adds an additional context to
the string that is marked for translation, which can help to disambiguate
short strings that might need different translations in different
parts of your program.
</para>
<para>
Code using these macros ends up looking like this:
<informalexample>
<programlisting>
 #include &lt;gi18n.h&gt;

 static const char *global_variable = N_("Translate this string");

 static void
 make_widgets (void)
 {
    GtkWidget *label1;
    GtkWidget *label2;

    label1 = gtk_label_new (_("Another string to translate"));
    label2 = gtk_label_new (_(global_variable));
...
</programlisting>
</informalexample>
</para>
<para>
Libraries using gettext should use dgettext() instead of gettext(), which
allows them to specify the translation domain each time they ask for a
translation. Libraries should also avoid calling textdomain(), since
they will be specifying the domain instead of using the default.
</para>
<para>
With the convention that the macro <literal>GETTEXT_PACKAGE</literal> is
defined to hold your libraries translation domain,
<filename>gi18n-lib.h</filename> can be included to provide
the following convenience:
<informalexample>
<programlisting>
  #define _(x) dgettext (GETTEXT_PACKAGE, x)
</programlisting>
</informalexample>
</para>

<question>
<para>
How do I use non-ASCII characters in GTK+ programs ?
</para>
</question>

<answer>
<para>
GTK+ uses <ulink url="http://www.unicode.org">Unicode</ulink> (more exactly
UTF-8) for all text. UTF-8 encodes each Unicode codepoint as a sequence of
one to six bytes and has a number of nice properties which make it a good
choice for working with Unicode text in C programs:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>
ASCII characters are encoded by their familiar ASCII codepoints.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
ASCII characters never appear as part of any other character.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
The zero byte doesn't occur as part of a character, so that UTF-8 strings
can be manipulated with the usual C library functions for handling
zero-terminated strings.
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
More information about Unicode and UTF-8 can be found in the
<ulink url="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html">UTF-8 and Unicode
FAQ for Unix/Linux</ulink>.
GLib provides functions for converting strings between UTF-8 and other
encodings, see g_locale_to_utf8() and g_convert().
</para>
<para>
Text coming from external sources (e.g. files or user input), has to be
converted to UTF-8 before being handed over to GTK+. The following example
writes the content of a IS0-8859-1 encoded text file to
<literal>stdout</literal>:
<informalexample><programlisting>
gchar *text, *utf8_text;
gsize length;
GError *error = NULL;

if (g_file_get_contents (filename, &amp;text, &amp;length, NULL))
  {
     utf8_text = g_convert (text, length, "UTF-8", "ISO-8859-1",
                            NULL, NULL, &amp;error);
     if (error != NULL)
       {
         fprintf ("Couldn't convert file &percnt;s to UTF-8\n", filename);
         g_error_free (error);
       }
     else
       g_print (utf8_text);
  }
else
  fprintf (stderr, "Unable to read file &percnt;s\n", filename);
</programlisting></informalexample>
</para>
<para>
For string literals in the source code, there are several alternatives for
handling non-ASCII content:
<variablelist>
<varlistentry><term>direct UTF-8</term>
<listitem><para>
If your editor and compiler are capable of handling UTF-8 encoded sources,
it is very convenient to simply use UTF-8 for string literals, since it
allows you to edit the strings in "wysiwyg". Note that choosing this option
may reduce the portability of your code.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term>escaped UTF-8</term>
<listitem><para>
Even if your toolchain can't handle UTF-8 directly, you can still encode
string literals in UTF-8 by using octal or hexadecimal escapes like
<literal>\212</literal> or <literal>\xa8</literal> to encode each byte.
This is portable, but modifying the escaped strings is not very convenient.
Be careful when mixing hexadecimal escapes with ordinary text;
<literal>"\xa8abcd"</literal> is a string of length 1 !
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term>runtime conversion</term>
<listitem><para>
If the string literals can be represented in an encoding which your
toolchain can handle (e.g. IS0-8859-1), you can write your source files
in that encoding and use g_convert() to convert the strings to UTF-8 at
runtime. Note that this has some runtime overhead, so you may want to move
the conversion out of inner loops.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
Here is an example showing the three approaches using the copyright sign
&copy; which has Unicode and ISO-8859-1 codepoint 169 and is represented
in UTF-8 by the two bytes 194, 169, or <literal>"\302\251"</literal> as
a string literal:
<informalexample><programlisting>
g_print ("direct UTF-8: &copy;");
g_print ("escaped UTF-8: \302\251");
text = g_convert ("runtime conversion: &copy;", -1, "ISO-8859-1", "UTF-8", NULL, NULL, NULL);
g_print(text);
g_free (text);
</programlisting></informalexample>
</para>
<para>
If you are using gettext() to localize your application, you need to
call bind_textdomain_codeset() to ensure that translated strings are
returned in UTF-8 encoding.
</para>

<question><para>
How do I use GTK+ with C++?
</para></question>

<answer>
<para>
There are two ways to approach this. The GTK+ header files use the subset
of C that's also valid C++, so you can simply use the normal GTK+ API
in a C++ program. Alternatively, you can use a "C++ binding"
such as <ulink url="http://gtkmm.sourceforge.net/">gtkmm</ulink>
which provides a native C++ API.
</para>
<para>
When using GTK+ directly, keep in mind that only functions can be
connected to signals, not methods. So you will need to use global
functions or "static" class functions for signal connections.
</para>
<para>
Another common issue when using GTK+ directly is that
C++ will not implicitly convert an integer to an enumeration.
This comes up when using bitfields; in C you can write the following
code:
<informalexample>
<programlisting>
  gdk_window_set_events (gdk_window,
                         GDK_BUTTON_PRESS_MASK | GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE_MASK);
</programlisting>
</informalexample>
while in C++ you must write:
<informalexample>
<programlisting>
  gdk_window_set_events (gdk_window,
                         (GdkEventMask) GDK_BUTTON_PRESS_MASK | GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE_MASK);
</programlisting>
</informalexample>
There are very few functions that require this cast, however.

<para>
To load an image file straight into a display widget, use
gtk_image_new_from_file() <footnote><para> If the file load fails,
gtk_image_new_from_file() will display no image graphic &mdash; to detect
a failed load yourself, use gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file() directly, then
gtk_image_new_from_pixbuf().</para></footnote>.
To load an image for another purpose, use gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file(). To i
load an animation, use gdk_pixbuf_animation_new_from_file().
gdk_pixbuf_animation_new_from_file() can also load non-animated images, so
use it in combination with gdk_pixbuf_animation_is_static_image() to load a
file of unknown type.

<question>
<para>
Why are types not registered if I use their <literal>GTK_TYPE_BLAH</literal>
macro ?
</para>
</question>

<answer>
<para>
The <literal>GTK_TYPE_BLAH</literal> macros are defined as calls to
<literal>gtk_blah_get_type()</literal>, and the <literal>_get_type()</literal> i
functions are declared as %G_GNUC_CONST which allows the compiler to optimize
the call away if it appears that the value is not being used.
</para>

<para>
A common workaround for this problem is to store the result in a volatile
variable, which keeps the compiler from optimizing the call away.

<question>
<para>
How do I create a transparent toplevel window ?
</para>
</question>

<answer>
<para>
To make a window transparent, it needs to use a visual which supports that.
This is done by getting the RGBA visual of the screen with
gdk_screen_get_rgba_visual() and setting it on the window. Note that
gdk_screen_get_rgba_visual() will return %NULL if transparent windows
are not supported on the screen, you should fall back to
gdk_screen_get_system_visual() in that case. Additionally, note that this
will change from screen to screen, so it needs to be repeated whenever the
window is moved to a different screen.
<informalexample><programlisting>
GdkVisual *visual;

visual = gdk_screen_get_rgba_visual (screen);
if (visual == NULL)
  visual = gdk_screen_get_system_visual (screen);

gtk_widget_set_visual (GTK_WIDGET (window), visual);
</programlisting></informalexample>
To fill the alpha channel on the window simply use cairos
RGBA drawing capabilities.
</para>
<para>
Note that the presence of an RGBA visual is no guarantee that the
window will actually appear transparent on screen. On X11, this
requires a compositing manager to be running. See
gtk_widget_is_composited() for a way to find out if the alpha
channel will be respected.

How do I change the font of a widget?
</para></question>

<answer><para>
This has several possible answers, depending on what exactly you want to
achieve. One option is gtk_widget_override_font().
<informalexample><programlisting>
 PangoFontDesc *font_desc = pango_font_description_new (<!-- -->);
 pango_font_description_set_size (font_desc, 40);
 gtk_widget_override_font (widget, font);
 pango_font_description_free (font_desc);
</programlisting></informalexample>
</para>
<para>
If you want to make the text of a label larger, you can use
gtk_label_set_markup():
<informalexample><programlisting>
gtk_label_set_markup (label, "&lt;big&gt;big text&lt;/big&gt;");
</programlisting></informalexample>
This is preferred for many apps because it's a relative size to the
user's chosen font size. See g_markup_escape_text() if you are
constructing such strings on the fly.
</para>
<para>
You can also change the font of a widget by putting
<programlisting>
 .my-widget-class {
   font: Sans 30;
 }
</programlisting>
in a CSS file, loading it with gtk_css_provider_load_from_file(), and
adding the provider with gtk_style_context_add_provider_for_screen().
To associate this style information with your widget, set a style class
on its #GtkStyleContext using gtk_style_context_add_class().
The advantage of this approach is that users can then override the font
you have chosen. See the #GtkStyleContext documentation for more discussion.

How do I make a text view scroll to the end of the buffer automatically ?

</question>

<answer>
<para>
A good way to keep a text buffer scrolled to the end is to place a
<link linkend="GtkTextMark">mark</link> at the end of the buffer, and
give it right gravity. The gravity has the effect that text inserted
at the mark gets inserted <emphasis>before</emphasis>, keeping the mark
at the end.

<para>
To ensure that the end of the buffer remains visible, use
gtk_text_view_scroll_to_mark() to scroll to the mark after
inserting new text.

<question><para>
How do I change the way that numbers are formatted by #GtkTreeView?
</para></question>
<answer><para>
Use gtk_tree_view_insert_column_with_data_func()
or gtk_tree_view_column_set_cell_data_func() and do the conversion
from number to string yourself (with, say, g_strdup_printf()).

The following example demonstrates this:
<informalexample><programlisting>
enum
{
  DOUBLE_COLUMN,
  N_COLUMNS
};

GtkListStore *mycolumns;
GtkTreeView *treeview;

void
my_cell_double_to_text (GtkTreeViewColumn *tree_column,
	                GtkCellRenderer   *cell,
                        GtkTreeModel      *tree_model,
	                GtkTreeIter       *iter,
                        gpointer           data)
{
  GtkCellRendererText *cell_text = (GtkCellRendererText *)cell;
  gdouble d;
  gchar *text;

  /* Get the double value from the model. */
  gtk_tree_model_get (tree_model, iter, (gint)data, &amp;d, -1);
  /* Now we can format the value ourselves. */
  text = g_strdup_printf ("&percnt;.2f", d);
  g_object_set (cell, "text", text, NULL);
  g_free (text);
}

void
set_up_new_columns (GtkTreeView *myview)
{
  GtkCellRendererText *renderer;
  GtkTreeViewColumn *column;
  GtkListStore *mycolumns;

  /* Create the data model and associate it with the given TreeView */
  mycolumns = gtk_list_store_new (N_COLUMNS, G_TYPE_DOUBLE);
  gtk_tree_view_set_model (myview, GTK_TREE_MODEL (mycolumns));

  /* Create a GtkCellRendererText */
  renderer = gtk_cell_renderer_text_new (<!-- -->);

  /* Create a new column that has a title ("Example column"),
   * uses the above created renderer that will render the double
   * value into text from the associated model's rows.
   */
  column = gtk_tree_view_column_new (<!-- -->);
  gtk_tree_view_column_set_title  (column, "Example column");
  renderer = gtk_cell_renderer_text_new (<!-- -->);
  gtk_tree_view_column_pack_start (column, renderer, TRUE);

  /* Append the new column after the GtkTreeView's previous columns. */
  gtk_tree_view_append_column (GTK_TREE_VIEW (myview), column);
  /* Since we created the column by hand, we can set it up for our
   * needs, e.g. set its minimum and maximum width, etc.
   */
  /* Set up a custom function that will be called when the column content
   * is rendered. We use the func_data pointer as an index into our
   * model. This is convenient when using multi column lists.
   */
  gtk_tree_view_column_set_cell_data_func (column, renderer,
	                                   my_cell_double_to_text,
                                           (gpointer)DOUBLE_COLUMN, NULL);

<question><para>
How do I use cairo to draw in GTK+ applications ?
</para></question>

<answer><para>
The #GtkWidget::draw signal gets a ready-to-use cairo context
as parameter that you should use.
</para>
<para>
All drawing in GTK+ is normally done in a draw handler, and GTK+
creates a temporary pixmap for double-buffering the drawing.
It is possible to turn off double-buffering, with
gtk_widget_set_double_buffered(), but this is not ideal,
since it can cause some flickering.

<question><para>
Can I improve the performance of my application by using the
Glitz or GL backend of cairo ?
</para></question>

<answer><para>
No. The GDK X11 backend uses the cairo X backend (and the other
GDK backends use their respective native cairo backends). The
GTK+ developers believe that the best way to improving the GDK
drawing performance is to optimize the cairo X backend and the
relevant code paths in the X server that is uses (mostly the
Render extension).

Can I use cairo to draw on a #GdkPixbuf ?
</para></question>

<answer><para>
No, at least not yet. The cairo image surface does not support the
pixel format used by GdkPixbuf.
