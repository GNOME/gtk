/* Model Button
 *
 * GtkModelButton is a button widget that is designed to be used with
 * a GAction as model. The button will adjust its appearance according
 * to the kind of action it is connected to.
 *
 * It is also possible to use GtkModelButton without a GAction. In this
 * case, you should set the "role" attribute yourself, and connect to the
 * "clicked" signal as you would for any other button.
 *
 * A common use of GtkModelButton is to implement menu-like content
 * in popovers.
