hy­phen­ation al­go­rithm is a <span allow_breaks="false" style="italic">set of rules</span>, espe­ci­ally one co­di­fied for im­ple­men­tation in a com­pu­ter pro­gram, that de­ci­des at which points a word can be bro­ken over two lines with a hy­phen. For ex­am­ple, a hy­phen­ation al­go­rithm might de­cide that im­peach­ment can be broken as impeach‧ment or im‧peachment but not impe‧achment.
