Overview of Changes in 4.15.0, 21-04-2024
=========================================

This release changes the default GSK renderer to be Vulkan, on
Wayland. Other platforms still use ngl.

The intent of this change is to get wider testing and verify that
Vulkan drivers are good enough for us to rely on. If significant
problems show up, we will revert this change for 4.16.

You can still override the renderer choice using the GSK_RENDERER
environment variable.

---

This release also changes font rendering settings by introducing
a new high-level gtk-font-rendering settings which gives GTK more
freedom to decide on font rendering.

You can still use the low-level font-related settings by changing
the new property to 'manual'.

(see for example https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/issues/6418 and

Overview of Changes in 4.13.6, 25-01-2024
=========================================

This release changes the ngl renderer to be the default renderer.

The intent of this change is to get wider testing and verify that
the new renderers are production-ready. If significant problems
show up, we will revert this change for 4.14.

You can still override the renderer choice using the GSK_RENDERER
environment variable.

Since ngl can handle fractional scaling much better than the old gl
renderer, we allow fractional scaling by default with gl now. If you
are using the old gl renderer (e.g. because your system is limited to
GLES2), you can disable fractional scaling by setting the GDK_DEBUG
environment variable to include the gl-no-fractional key.

* GtkListView:
 - Fix some corner cases with sections during insertions and deletions
 - Don't double-recycle widgets

* GSK:
 - Many fixes and improvements to the unified renderers:
   - Fix text rendering with the uber shader

   - Fix some memory leaks
   - Many text rendering fixes
   - Implement subpixel positioning for glyphs
   - Support custom fonts in node files
   - Add tests for font rendering
   - Fix drawing of repeat nodes

Overview of Changes in 4.13.5, 07-01-2024
=========================================

This release adds two new GSK renderers called vulkan and ngl,
that are built from the same sources. The new renderers can
handle many corner cases correctly that the current gl renderer
does not handle, and they offer advantages such as antialiasing
and supersampled gradients.

The new renderers are still considered experimental, and GTK
will only use them if they are explicitly selected using the
GSK_RENDERER environment variable.

As part of this work, the GSK include files have been rearranged.
It is no longer necessary to include renderer-specific headers for
ngl and vulkan (and doing so will trigger deprecation warnings),
and their constructors are always available.

The previously available experimental GdkVulkanContext APIs and
the old Vulkan renderer have been removed.

Vulkan is now enabled by default, and Linux distributions should
build GTK with Vulkan support. This requires the glslc shader
compiler as a new dependency.

Vulkan is now also used for dmabuf support.

 - Tweak GDK_DEBUG values. The new values are
   gl-disable-gl, gl-disable-gles and gl-prefer-gl.
