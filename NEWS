* More header cleanups.
* Fixed activation bug for insensitive widgets.
* Locale fixes to RC file parsing code.
* Miscellaneous bugfixes for Item Factory, CList, CTree, X Selections,
  HScale, VScale, Pixmap, Viewport, OptionMenu, Entry and Notebook.
* Upgrade to libtool 1.3.4.

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 1.2.6:

* container queue_resize fixes
* gtk[vh]scale: minor fixups
* rename idle to idle_id in testgtk to avoid conflicts with 
  broken libs
* More consistant naming of gtkrc files

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 1.2.5:

* more GtkCTree and GtkWindow bug fixes.
* more redraw/resize queue fixes, better expose event
  discarding code.
* more miscellaneous bugs fixed
* new configure.in option --disable-rebuilds to completely disable
  rebuilds of autogenerated sources.
* check for 5.002 now, to avoid failing autogeneration build rules due
  to old perl versions.
* fonts (and fontsets) are cached now.
* more autogeneration make rules and dependancy fixups, we should be
  save with autogeneration up to make -j12 now ;)
* new window position GTK_WIN_POS_CENTER_ALWAYS, which will recenter the
  GtkWindow on every size change.
* major rework of window manager hints handling code, fixed a bunch of
  races with the new resizing code.
* the new wm hints and resizing code is absolutely perfect and bug free now,
  it only lacks testing ;)
* fixed up various rc style memory prolems.
* gtk_widget_modify_style() now properly changes the style of realized widgets
  and references the style passed into it. if people worked around this bug,
  this will introduce a slight memory leak in their code.
  The code should typically look like:
            GtkRcStyle *rc_style = gtk_rc_style_new ();
            [...]
            gtk_widget_modify_style (widget, rc_style);
            gtk_rc_style_unref (rc_style);
* fix problems with positioning menus offscreen.
* GtkText fixes for some crashes and drawing errors.
* Better handling for unexpected window destroys in GDK and GTK+.
  This should make it possible to use a GtkPlug and catch the
  case where its parent socket is randomly killed.
* FAQ updates.
* FileSelection i18n patches, RadioButton fixups.
* many translation improvements.
* miscellaneous other bugs fixed.

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 1.2.4:

  GtkCTree.
* tutorial/FAQ updates, new file generation.txt on autogenerated sources.
* configure's --with-glib= is "officially" unsupported.
* upgrade to libtool 1.3.3.
* various buglets fixed.

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 1.2.3:

* Added gtk_object_get() facility to retrive object arguments easily.
  The var args list expects ("arg-name", &value) pairs.
* Fixed mapping for GdkInputCondition<->GIOCondition, this should fix
  problems where closed pipes were no longer signalling GDK_INPUT_READ on
  systems with a native poll().
* Some cleanups to GtkLabel's memory allocation code (shouldn't leak memory
  anymore).
* We don't attempt to lookup xpm color "None" anymore, this should prevent
  eXodus (commercial X windows server) from popping up a color dialog every
  time a transparent pixmap is created.
* Fixed bug where Gtk timout/idle handlers would execute without the global
  Gdk lock being held.
* Other minor bug fixes.

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 1.2.1:

* Many Bug fixes have been applied to the menu and accelerator code.
* GtkItemFactory can "adopt" foreign menu items now and manage their
  accelerator installation. This is often required to get GtkItemFactory
  like accelerator propagation between different windows with the same
  menu heirarchy and for centralized parsing and saving of accelerators.
* GtkCList/GtkCTree buttons should always display correctly now.
* Miscellaneous other bug fixes.

What's New in GTK+ 1.2.0 (since 1.0.x):

  widget->requisition is always what the widget requested,
  unmodified by the usize. See Changes-1.2.txt for details.
  This correct various bugs with gtk_widget_set_usize().
* Fixes for XIM on X11R5 systems
* Don't allow cut-and-paste of text in password-style entries
* --enable-debug is now on by default for the development releaes.
  (When compiling for "production", use --enable-debug=minimum)

* CList and CTree fixes
* Bug fixes for drawing problems. 
* Miscellaneous bug fixes to GtkLabel, GtkCList, GtkCTree,
  GtkColorsel, Focusing, DND
* Tutorial improvements

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 1.1.15:

* Tutorial Updates
* Added --libs gthread to gtk-config 
* Bug fixes

What is new in GTK+ 1.1.14:

* Additions to docs/Changes-1.2.txt
* Just warn when loading theme engine fails

    gtk_toggle_button_get_active()
* Some locale fixups in gtkrc code
* Fixes to make gtk_radio_button_set_group() keep only
  one radio button in the group active
* Foreign windows are now always treated as viewable; this fixes
  a problem where updating didn't occure properly in GtkPlug
* DND fixes for 64 bit architectures, and for specifying operations 
  with modifier keys.
* Major revisions to GtkLayout: avoid having to create window
  for NO_WINDOW children, adjust allocations of children as 
  scrolled so queued draws work, and a resize is queued instead
  of allocating directly in a put() or move()

What is new in GTK+ 1.1.13:

* Dnd and selection bug fixes and memory purification.
* Widget sensitivity fixups.
* Tooltips windows are now named "gtk-tooltips" so rc file rules
  can match tooltips windows. Fixed interaction of tooltips and NO_WINDOW
  widgets.
* Spin buttons now update their values upon value retrival.
* Overhaul of the resizing vs. redrawing logic to reduce redrawing needs
  a lot. Gtk makes full use of the draw_area coalescing code now, which
  got minorly improved as well.
* Containers map their Gdk windows after their children now to reduce
  expose event generation.
* Gdk event queue fixups, this solves the double-click problems people were
  recently having.
* Account for the fact that GSource's are only properly reentrant from
  within dispatch(), thus we don't do Gdk event processing from within
  check() or prepare() anymore.
* Rc files feature a bg_pixmap value of "<none>" now.
* Improved session management support in Gdk.  
* Automatic disabling of NLS if no gettext is found should work now.

  --gtk-modules= command line switch. such modules have to export a
  G_MODULE_EXPORT void gtk_module_init (gint *argc, gchar ***argv);
  function which will be invoked to initialize the module. since such
  modules may create new widget types, they are always resident.
* The tutorial has been updated again.
* Changes to menus including tearoff menus and accelerators.

  mechanism for speed and reusability. Child/object arguments don't
  need to be preceeded by the "GtkType::" portion anymore.
* Removed GtkAcceleratorTable in favour of GtkAccelGroup, accelerator display
  is now performed by a new widget GtkAccelLabel.
* Overhaul of the resizing code. Resizing behaviour can now be specified
  on GtkContainer basis, so the underlying algorithm isn't only available
  for GtkWindows.
* GtkTables are now fully resizable.

  function.
* GtkStyles and key bindings can now be looked up depending on the base
  types of a widget, through a new keyword `class' in rc files.
