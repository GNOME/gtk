Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.96.0
==================================

* DND has been refactored. There are now separate GdkDrag and GdkDrop
  objects. This work is still incomplete

* The GDK_SURFACE_SUBSURFACE surface type has been removed.

* Use of child surfaces has been greatly reduced. This work is still
  incomplete

* The use of global coordinates in GDK apis has been reduced. This
  work is still incomplete

* Events have been simplified and are used just for input
  - expose events have been replaced by a GdkSurface::render signal
  - configure events have been replaced by a GdkSurface::size-changed signal
  - map events have been replaced by a GdkSurface::mapped property
  - gdk_event_handler_set has been replaced by a GdkSurface::event signal
  - key events no longer contain a string
  - events on unmapped widgets are ignored

* Warping the pointer is no longer supported

* The Wayland backend now uses the Settings portal for GtkSettings

* The Wayland input module uses the text-input-unstable-v3 protocol

* The Broadway backend has been rewritten to work well with GSK

* The color chooser has a color picker

* GtkApplication tracks screensaver state and has a ::query-end signal

* The file chooser portal backend supports file filters

* A number of list models have been introduced, for internal use
  and as public api:
  - GtkMapListModel
  - GtkSliceListModel
  - GtkSortListModel
  - GtkSelectionModel
  - GtkSingleSelection

* Support for tabular menus and combo boxes has been dropped

* Key themes are no longer supported

* GtkInvisible has been dropped

* A GtkRoot interface has been added that is currently implemented
  just by GtkWindow. This work is incomplete

* GtkWidgets can transform their children using projective linear
  transformations. This functionality is available in CSS and
  as GskTransform argument to gtk_widget_allocate. GtkFixed is
  a container that exposes this functionality. For examples of this,
  see the swing transition of GtkRevealer, the rotate transitions
  of GtkStack or the Fixed Layout example in gtk-demo.

* GtkEntry functionality has been moved into a new GtkText widget,
  the GtkEditable interface has been expanded, and new a new
  GtkPasswordEntry widget has been introduced.

* Focus handling has been rewritten, and focus-change event
  generation has been unified with crossing events.

* All demos and settings schemas have been renamed to avoid collisions
  with GTK3.

* GtkWidget can now use a GtkLayoutManager for size allocation.
  Layout managers can optionally use layout children holding layout
  properties. A number of layout managers are available:
  - GtkBinLayout
  - GtkBoxLayout
  - GtkGridLayout
  - GtkFixedLayout
  - GtkCustomLayout
  More layout manager implementations will appear in the future.

* GtkAssistant, GtkStack and GtkNotebook now have publicly
  accessible page objects for their children. The page objects
  are also exposed via a list model.

* GtkContainer no longer supports child properties. All existing
  child properties have been removed, converted to regular properties,
  moved to layout properties or moved to child meta objects.

* GtkListBox has gained a ::show-separators property that gets
  translated into a CSS style class.

* A number of X11-specific GtkWindow and GdkSurface apis have been
  removed or changed to backend APIs.

* GtkBuilder can specify object-valued properties inline.

* The gtk4-builder-tool simplify command has gained a --3to4 option
  to convert GTK3 ui files to GTK4.

* The inspector can show child meta objects and layout properties.


Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.94.0
==================================

* GdkPaintable is a new, powerful abstraction for drawable content.
  gtk4-demo has a new "Paint" demo to show some of its capabilities.

* There is support for displaying media, with
  GtkVideo
  GtkMediaFile
  GtkMediaStream
  GtkMediaControls

* GtkFontChooser now supports OpenType font variations and features.

* The Ctrl-Shift-E support in the simple IM context has been replaced
  by an optional completion popup for Emoji alpha codes. This can be
  enabled with the GtkEntry::enable-emoji-completion property.

* Wayland has an input method based on the text protocol now

* Input methods, print backends and media backends have been converted
  to GIOModules and extension points, and support for generic loadable
  modules has been dropped. Platform im modules are always included.

* GdkWindow has been renamed to GdkSurface.

* Applications can now create their own GtkSnapshot objects for
  intermediate rendering.

* Widget event signals have been replaced by event controllers,
  and some new event controllers have been introduced for this:
  GtkEventControllerMotion
  GtkEventControllerKey
  GtkGestureStylus

* Event controllers can now be created in .ui files.

* Invalidation tracking has been changed, only gtk_widget_queue_draw is left.

* Observing widget contents and size is now done by using the
  GtkWidgetPaintable object instead of connecting to widget signals.

* The GtkWidget::draw signal has been removed, widgets need
  to implement GtkWidget::snapshot.

* GdkTexture now has GdkMemoryTexture and GdkGLTexture subclasses.

* The Vulkan support in GDK can now use a particular device that is
  specified by the GDK_VULKAN_DEVICE environment variable. use
  GDK_VULKAN_DEVICE=list to see them all.

* GTK+ Inspector
  - has logging support, and the logging settings have been cleaned up
  - has an fps overlay

* Removed APIs and features:
  Individual event signals such as ::proximity-in-event
  The ::draw signal
  threading support
  non-platform IM modules
  papi and test print backends
  GtkPlacesSidebar
  GtkRecentChooser
  GtkToolPalette
  GdkStatus
  gtk_true, gtk_false
  gtk_widget_show_now
  gtk_widget_draw
  gtk_render_icon_surface

* Incomplete transitions:
  The ::event signal is not still there, but it will be removed
  The DND apis are not finalized yet

* Translation updates:

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.93.0
==================================

Major changes:

* GdkScreen has been removed. All screen-related APIs have equivalents
  in GdkDisplay. This affects APIs in both GDK and GTK, for example,
  the GtkWidget::screen-changed signal has been replaced by a new
  ::display-changed signal. As part of this change, there is no longer
  a GdkWindow representing the root window. The X11 backend has APIs
  to get X screens and root windows.

* GdkVisual has been removed.

* GdkDeviceManager has been replaced by GdkSeat. 

* Clipboard handling has been moved from GTK to GDK, and has been
  modernized to provide an extensible, asynchronous, stream-based API.
  This affects APIs in both GDK and GTK. GdkSelection has been replaced
  by GdkContentFormats, GdkContentProvider, GdkContentSerializer and
  GdkContentDeserializer. Selection-related events and APIs have
  been removed.
  This conversion is complete for copy-paste, the drag-and-drop APIs
  are still in flux.

* The GdkCursor API has been modernized. We no longer have the
  GdkCursorType enumeration. Instead, can be created from names
  or from GdkTextures. In GTK, we now have gtk_widget_set_cursor().

* Settings and window-state changes have been converted from events
  to signals on GdkDisplay and GdkWindow, respectively.

* GdkEvent has been converted to an opaque GObject.

* The GL renderer in GSK has been substantially completed, and is now
  on par with the Vulkan renderer.

* The use of GdkPixbuf in APIs has been reduced, and the GskTexture
  object has been moved to GDK as GdkTexture, to take its place. This
  change affects both GDK and GTK, for example the GtkAboutDialog::logo
  property now accepts a GdkTexture. As part of these changes,
  support for GdkPixbufAnimation has been dropped.

* The handling of icon sizes has been changed. The GtkIconSize
  enumeration allows selection normal or large icons now, and the
  actual icon size is determined by the theme, using the -gtk-icon-size
  CSS property. Among other things, this allows animating icon size changes.

Smaller changes:

* Build system:
 - Meson can now be used to build GTK+ on Windows
 - We install print backends again
 - libepoxy 1.4 is required
 - libcloudproviders 0.2.5 is required

* GDK:
 - gdk_keymap_get_for_display has been renamed to gdk_display_get_keymap
 - We are no longer reading the GDK_DPI_SCALE environment variable
 - The GdkX11Display::xevent signal has been added (to eventually replace event filters)
 - gdk_pango_context_get_for_screen and gdk_pango_context_get have been dropped
 - Default-display wrappers like gdk_set_double_click_time, gdk_beep, gdk_flush or
   gdk_notify_startup_complete have been dropped
 - gdk_display_set_program_class has been moved to the X11 backend
 - The gdk_error_trap_push/pop APIs have been dropped, the X11 backend still has them

* Wayland:
 - The Wayland backend now implements the KDE server-side decoration protocol

* Broadway:
 - Broadway has been ported to GSK
 - Only Unix domain sockets are supported now (we are passing fds to upload textures)

* GSK:
 - We use cached textures for icons now
 - We also use cached textures for symbolic icons, and recolor using a shader
 - The glyph cache supports hi-dpi
 - Some render node APIs have been tweaked: cairo, text, transform nodes
 - GskRenderer::scale-factor and GskRenderer::viewport have been dropped
 - gsk_render_node_set_scaling_filters has been dropped

* GTK:
 - A new event controller, GtkEventControllerMotion, is intended to replace
   most remaining uses of ::motion-notify-event
 - New APIS: gtk_widget_contains and gtk_widget_pick
 - gtk_widget_get_content_size has been replaced by gtk_widget_get_width/height
 - The GtkWidget:parent-set signal has been dropped
 - GtkHeaderBar::show-close-button has been renamed to ::show-title-buttons
 - GtkFontButton::font-name has been replaced by GtkFontChooser::font
 - The GtkTextTag::event signal has been dropped
 - The text buffer serialization API has been removed
 - We longer install 'semi-private' headers like gtktextlayout.h or gtktextdisplay.h
 - gtk_application_is_inhibited has been dropped

* Theming:
 - Focus rendering has been changed. Outlines are always rendered now, and
   we set the :focus and :focus(visible) pseudo-classes on elements to allow
   the theme control over where to render focus rectangles
 - The font-feature-settings CSS property is supported
 - The -gtk-icon-size custom CSS property allows theme control of icon sizes

* Emoji:
 - We support Ctrl-. and Ctrl-; to pop up the Emoji chooser
 - The Emoji chooser is also available in GtkTextView
 - We avoid overly wide fallback rendering with some EmojiOne fonts

* GtkInspector:
 - The inspector shows more render node details
 - The UI has been slightly reorganized

* Bugs fixed:

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.92.1, 重庆市
==========================================

The bulk of the preparation for this release was done during
and after the fantastic GNOME.Asia Summit 2017 in Chongqing, China.

* Drop autotools support. Meson 0.42.1 is now required

* Implement most of CSS3 font-variant

* Add an Emoji chooser to GtkEntry

* Add support for native file choosers on older OS X versions

* Add support for libcloudproviders in GtkPlacesSidebar

* Non-windowed widgets are now allowed to have a size of 0x0

* Allow tiled windows to be resized. Under wayland, this uses version 2
  of the gtk-shell protocol. Under X, it uses the _GTK_EDGE_CONSTRAINTS
  property

* Input handling changes
 - GdkEvent has new accessors for fields
 - Traditional event signals (eg ::key-press-event) are now emitted from
   an event controller
 - Most widgets inside gtk have stopped using traditional event signals

* Scrollbars allow middle-click to jump to a position again

* GSK changes:
 - Add gsk_text_node_new
 - Add a glyph cache for the Vulkan backend
 - Add gsk_blur_node_new
 - Add gsk_cross_fade_node_new
 - Implement blur for Vulkan
 - Implement repeat nodes for Vulkan
 - Add gsk_blend_mode_new
 - the vulkan backend now uses multiple render passes, avoiding many
   fallbacks to cairo rendering
 - The profiling output for vulkan is now more useful, showing how many
   pixels of fallback rendering and intermediate textures we consume

* Inspector:
 - The recorder shows more useful information about render nodes
 - The general tab shows gsk and vulkan information

* Removed apis
 - gdk_window_new_input
 - gtk_widget_set_redraw_on_alloc

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.89.1
==================================

This release marks the first snapshot of development leading to GTK+ 4,
it is unstable and expected to change drastically.

Do not use it in production.

GTK+ 3.89 is parallel-installable with the stable GTK+ 3.22.x releases.

The API documentation contains an initial migration guide for porting
from GTK+ 3 to GTK+ 4.

Detailed changes:

* GSK has been integrated. Widgets are now rendered into
  GskRenderNodes, which then get drawn using GL

* GTK+ now installs a single shared library, libgtk.so, which includes
  GDK and GSK as well

* All installed binaries now use a consistent gtk4- prefix to avoid conflicts

* Dropped APIs:
  - all APIs that have been deprecated in GTK+ 3
  - (almost) all widget style properties
  - offscreen windows
  - -gtk-gradient in CSS
  - gdk_pixbuf_get_from_window and gdk_cairo_set_source_window

* Changed APIs:
 - GtkCssProvider load functions lost their GError argument

* New APIs:
 - GMenu items can now have a text-direction attribute
 - GtkShortcutsShortcut supports single-finger swipe gestures
 - gdk_display_is_rgba and gdk_display_is_composited
 - New GtkButton API to construct image buttons:
     gtk_button_new_from_icon_name
     gtk_button_set_icon_name
 - New GdkWindow constructors replacing gdk_window_new:
     gdk_window_new_toplevel
     gdk_window_new_popup
     gdk_window_new_temp
     gdk_window_new_child
     gdk_window_new_input
     gdk_wayland_window_new_subsurface
 - gtk_widget_measure replaces gtk_widget_get_preferred_...
 - gtk_widget_snapshot replaces gtk_widget_render
 - gtk_drawing_area_set_draw_func replaces the ::draw signal

* New examples in gtk4-demo:
 - Gestures
 - Fishbowl

* GtkInspector now has a frame recorder which shows detailed information
  about the widget to render node conversion

* Hi-DPI is now supported with the Windows backend

* gtk-builder-tool can now replace the input file

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.19.5
==================================

* GtkShortcutsWindow:
 - GtkShortcutsGesture has been removed, since GtkShortcutsShortcut
   can now document gestures

* GtkFileChooser:
 - The places view now shows the available space when that information
   is available
 - Problems with remembering the dialog size have been fixed

* CSS changes:
 - CSS margins, border and padding are more consistently supported
 - Many widgets now support min-width and min-height
 - Many style properties have been superseded by CSS properties

* Adwaita:
 - Some visual updates and fixes

* Wayland:
 - DND with icon widgets is working properly

* GDK:
 - More of the DND implementation is now handled in GDK: creating the
   drag window, moving the window along with the cursor, the drag
   cancel animation.
 - GdkSeat is a new API that supersedes grabs on individual devices and
   is a better fit for backends like Wayland or Mir

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.19.4
==================================

* GtkPopover can now be instructed to stay within the toplevel window
  on platforms that don't already enforce this (such as Wayland)
 
* Wayland:
 - Memory leak fixes
 - Window positioning and sizing fixes
 - Clipboard and DND fixes

 - Active spinners are now :checked, not :active
 - A -gtk-icontheme property has been added
 - A -gtk-icon-palette has been added to allow recoloring symbolic icons
 - Drag highlighting uses the new :dnd pseudoclass

* DND:

 - Change the handling of drag windows to work on Wayland. The drag window
   implementation has been moved to GDK, with the new function
   gdk_drag_context_get_drag_window
 - Non-toplevel widgets can be used as drag widgets

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.19.3
==================================

* Theming changes
 - Non-standard CSS properties have been renamed to have a -gtk-
   prefix (the old names still work, with a warning):
     gtk-key-bindings is now -gtk-key-bindings
     icon-shadow is now -gtk-icon-shadow
 - CSS parsing errors and warnings are shown in the inspector

* GtkShortcutsWindow:
 - Widgets are more complete, to allow supporting them in glade
 - GtkShortcutsShortcut can now show gestures as well, GtkShortcutsGesture
   is no longer needed and will be removed soon
 - GtkShortcutsShortcut supports standard gestures, with predefined
   icons and subtitles

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.19.2
==================================

* Most widgets have been ported to CSS nodes. The element names and
  the tree relationships are documented now. The Adwaita and HighContrast
  themes have been mostly kept up-to-date with these changes. Third-party
  themes and custom CSS will need adjustments.

* The inspector now shows CSS nodes and allows to manipulate them.

* Size allocation has been simplified to avoid excessive resizes of
  the entire window.

* GtkShortcutsWindow can now display direction-dependent shortcuts
  and sequences of keys.

* Support for native file chooser on Win32 when using the new
  GtkFileChooserNative API, and when using GtkFileChooserButton.

* The GtkFileChooser interface prerequisite was changed from GtkWidget
  to GObject to allow non-widget filechooser implementations.

* :focus-on-click has been moved from various subclasses to GtkWidget,
  so it is now available for every widget, in particular GtkListBoxRow.

* Bugs fixed:
 735341 Fix/improve gtk_text_buffer_get_iter_at_*() functions

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.19.1
==================================

* Support for help overlays to document keyboard shortcuts and gestures
  has been added

* GdkAppLaunchContext is now setting the DISPLAY environment variable
  for X11

* Support for GL legacy profiles has been added back

* GTK+ now loads compose tables in the format used by XLib from
  ~/.config/gtk-3.0/Compose, ~/.XCompose and the X11 locale information

* GtkBuilder can now create GFile objects, for use in e.g. GFileIcons.

* New APIs:
 - GtkShortcutsWindow
 - gtk_text_tag_changed
 - gtk_settings_reset_property
 - gdk_rectangle_equal
 - gdk_gl_context_is_legacy

* A new commandline utility, gtk-query-settings, to query GTK+ settings,
  has been added

* Theming: Element names are now supported.
  A number of widgets have already been changed to use element names for
  the widget itself and its various subelements. This effort will continue
  in next development releases.
  This change will require adjustments in themes and custom css - as part of
  this transition, the element names and style classes in use are documented
  and will be stable going forward.

* Debugging: GtkInspector can now edit string-array-valued properties

* Wayland:
 - Fix transparent terminals
 - Fix treeview search popups

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.15.12
===================================

* GtkMenuButton:
 - Improve accessible names

* GtkCellRendererPixbuf:
 - Always follow state changes, the ::follow-state property
   is now ignored. This is necessary to make HighContrast
   and symbolic icons remain visible e.g. in selected rows.

* GtkEntry:

   changed the semantics of the get_frame_size() vfunc. GtkEntry
   subclasses that override this vfunc may need adjustment.

* Wayland:
 - Support hi-dpi cursors

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.15.5
==================================

* GTK+ types now support the GLib g_autoptr() facility for
  automatic cleanup of automatic variables. GTK+ itself does
  not use g_autoptr() internally.

* GtkSearchEntry has gained ::next-match, ::previous-match
  and ::stop-search signals and a gtk_search_entry_handle_event()
  function, which help in providing a richer search experience
  and make search entries usable outside of GtkSearchBar.

* GtkFileChooser:
 - The search has been reintegrated in the UI, there is now
   a toggle button on the header bar to go to search mode,
   in addition to the Alt-S shortcut.
 - The file chooser button now accepts files by drag-and-drop properly.

* GtkScrolledWindow has gained a new ::edge-reached signal, which
  triggers when the edge of the scrollable area is reached.

* CSS:
 - Performance improvements

* OpenGL:
 - It is now possible to specify the required GL version, as well
   as some other options (debug, forward compatible) when creating
   a GdkGLContext
 - Support for the OpenGL legacy profile has been dropped. Most examples
   have been updated, with the exception of gdkgears, which will be fixed
   in the next snapshot
 - Use shader version 1.50

* Mir backend: Many improvements

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.11.3 to 3.11.4
============================================

* GtkActionBar: A new container, which has a centered
  child like GtkHeaderBar. It can be used in places
  where header bar theming is not suitable

* GtkAppChooser: The online support has been simplified
  and modernized 

* GtkHeaderBar button theming has been changed to be
  more flexible. There is now a gtk-decoraton-layout
  setting and a decoration-layout property.

* Accessibility:
  - Links in labels are now accessible
  - Model-based menus are accessible
  - Accessible roles of several widgets have been fixed
  - GtkColorChooser accessibility is improved

* Theming: The Raleigh theme has been updated for
  several new features, including client-side decorations

* Model-based menus now support a hidden-when attribute
  on items that allows them to be hidden on various
  conditions

* Bugs fixed:
 688421 GMenuModel menus should have a hint to hide items

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.11.0 to 3.11.1
============================================

* Theming:
 - A number of containers have been changed to draw
   backgrounds and borders. By default these are fully
   transparent, so nothing should change:
   GtkBox GtkFixed GtkGrid GtkEventBox
 - Link colors are not rendered using the :visited and :link
   states instead of the link-color and visited-link-color
   style properties

* Broadway:
 - Use client-side decorations
 - Implement window movement, raise/lower
 - Use rolling hashes for optimizing scrolling
 - Use click-to-focus
 - Support touch events
 - Support IPad on-screen keyboard

* GtkFileChooser:
 - Respect local-only in the places sidebar
 - Filter out duplicate application shortcuts
 - Show unmounted bookmarks

* GtkProgressBar:
 - Activity mode is now using a tick callback to move the block
   smoothly

* GtkWindow:
 - Fix size allocation for the fallback menubar
 - Improve application menu fallback if we have client-side
   decorations or a header bar

* GtkBuilder:
 - No longer requires every object to have an id

* Bugs fixed:

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.10 to 3.11.0
==========================================

* New notebook tab styling: GtkNotebook now offers a way
  for themes to opt out of the tab rendering, with the
  'has-tab-gap' style property. The Adwaita theme is using
  this to achieve a more modern tab appearance.

* GtkFlowBox: A container that its children in a reflowing
  grid, which can be oriented horizontally or vertically.
  It is similar to GtkListBox in that the children can
  be sorted and filtered, and by requiring a dedicated child
  widget type, GtkFlowBoxChild. It is similar to GtkTreeView
  in that is supports a full set of selection modes, including
  rubberband selection.

* GtkStack: children can now indicate that they require
  attention by setting the needs-attention child property.

* Broadway now requires binary array buffers and modern WebSocket
  protocol support

* Autoscrolling in range widgets has been improved to work more
  reliably in maximized windows.

* GtkSpinner has been changed to render in in a limited set of
  sizes.

* GtkApplication now stores and handles accelerators for GActions
  itself.

* GtkIconTheme now falls back to the gnome icontheme to fix
  problems with the availability of symbolic icons in other
  icon themes.

* GTK+ respects the deprecated gtk-button-images and gtk-menu-images
  settings again.

* Bugs fixed:
 168530 gtk_accel_map_load: wasteful extra stat call.

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.9.6 to 3.9.8
==========================================

* We've started deprecating GtkStock apis. These apis will continue
  working until GTK+ 4, so there is no need to rush to replace them.
  For more information, see
  https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gtk-devel-list/2013-July/msg00000.html
  Wholly deprecated as part of this effort:
  GtkIconFactory, GtkIconSet, GtkIconSource, GtkImageMenuItem,
  GtkAction, GtkUIManager

* The GtkSettings cleanup that was discussed at the recent GTK+
  hackfest has started to land. A number of settings have been
  deprecated and are ignored now:
  gtk-button-images,
  gtk-show-unicode-menu,
  gtk-show-input-method-menu,
  gtk-enable-mnemonics,
  gtk-auto-mnemonics,
  gtk-color-palette,
  gtk-can-change-accels,
  cursor blink settings,
  gtk-fallback-icon-theme,
  gtk-scrolled-window-placement,
  menu popup delay settings,
  gtk-menu-bar-accel,
  keynav tweaks,
  gtk-touchscreen-mode,
  gtk-icon-sizes,
  im style tweaks,
  gtk-file-chooser-backend,
  gtk-enable-tooltips,
  gtk-visible-focus,
  tooltip timeout tweaks,
  toolbar style tweaks

* Initial support for scaled output (on high-dpi screens) has been
  added. While this can be built with cairo 1.12, it needs a cairo
  branch to work. Support for this has been added to the Wayland,
  OS X and Windows backends.

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.9.0 to 3.9.2
==========================================

* The GDK initialization code has been refactored. GdkDisplayManager
  is no longer backend-specific.

* The symbol exporting functionality has been refactored. We no longer
  use .symbols files, and instead rely on explicit header annotations
  for every exported symbol. the abicheck scripts are no longer used.

* The GDK drawing and scrolling has been simplified. We no longer use
  XCopyArea for scrolling, instead an offscreen cache is used. There
  is a new debug flag, GTK_DEBUG=pixel-cache for this.

* Window sizing issues have been addressed.

* Implement height-for-width for GtkEventBox and GtkCheckButton

* Custom titlebars can now be set from GtkBuilder files

* Optionally install tests, when configured with --enable-installed-tests.
  To run these tests, gnome-desktop-testing-runner can be used.

* Native input methods are supported on OS X now.

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.7 to 3.9
======================================

* GtkFileChooser:
 - Always show fuse-mounted locations in shortcuts
 - GtkFileChooserButton has received a lot of fixes and tests have
   been added for many of them

* GtkWindow:
 - Initial support for client-side decorations has been added. This
   is going to be used by default under Wayland. To try it with other
   backends, set the GTK_CSD=1 environment variable.
 - gtk_window_set_titlebar: A new function that can set a custom,
   client-side titlebar on toplevel windows.

* Wayland:
 - Use client-side decorations
 - Implement maximization
 - Improve cursor handling
 - Improve multi-monitor handling
 - Support most GtkSettings (for now by reading GSettings directly)
 - Complete the keymap implementation
 - Add support for custom surfaces
 - Implement animated cursors
 - Support the WAYLAND_SOCKET environment variable
 - Implement frame synchronizatio
 - Document Wayland-specific APIs

* Broadway:
 - Improve window size handling
 - Implement frame synchronization
 - Add support for password authentication

* New APIs, widgets, feature additions:
 - GtkHeaderBar is a new widget similar to a GtkBox, with the extra
   feature that it can center a child (typically a title), independent
   of the other content.
 - GtkPlacesSidebar is the sidebar widget in the file chooser, exported
   as a public widget - it will be shared with nautilus.
 - GtkStack is an alternative to GtkNotebook for showing one of several
   child widgets at a time. It supports animated transitions. Tabs are
   not built into this widgets, but instead provided by the separate
   GtkStackSwitcher widget.
 - GtkRevealer is a new new widget that can hide or show its child
   in an animated fashion.
 - GtkMenuTracker is a helper object that makes dealing with
   GMenuModels easier and more efficient.
 - gtk_grid_remove_row/column: New functions to remove whole rows
   or columns from a GtkGrid
 - Support for composite children has been added to GtkWidget. This
   allows to create complex widgets from GtkBuilder ui files. All
   complex GTK+ widgets have been converted to use this facility.
 - Baseline support was added to the GTK+ size allocation machinery.
   Widgets can now export the baseline of the text they contain,
   and containers can align their children wrt to their baselines.


* Known problems, feature removals, compatibility caveats:
 - Handling of window size is currently in flux, and there are
   some known problems with sizes unintentionally changing
 - Support for the Motif DND protocol has been dropped
 - Client-side decorations still have some issues when drawing
   directly on toplevel windows or setting their background
 - Support for multiple screens per display has been removed. This
   was only ever supported on X11, and is an exceedingly rare setup
   nowadays. The display-screen relation is now 1:1, and we will do
   some more simplification of displaymanager/display/screen/monitor
   APIs.
 - gdk_window_get_display has been deprecated
 - gtk_widget_push_composite_child has been deprecated - this was
   used for anything
 - GtkSwitch has been changed to draw focus internally, instead of
   reserving space outside the switch for it. This may require some
   application adjustment where margins were tweaked to 'correct'
   the alignment of switches manually

* Printing:
 - Avoid blocking when looking for avahi printers
 - Don't link against avahi-gobject, use D-Bus directly

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.7.10
==================================

* We now support the Window Manager frame synchronization protocol draft (when
  running under a WM that supports it). This means applications will throttle
  their drawing cycle to what the compositor is drawing, and the compositor
  will never render half-updated windows, for seamless resizing and improved
  smoothness in drawing.
  See https://mail.gnome.org/archives/wm-spec-list/2013-January/msg00000.html
  and the articles at http://blog.fishsoup.net/ for more details.

* We now support setting an opacity to any GtkWidget, not just toplevels:
  gtk_window_set_opacity has been deprecated in favor of gtk_widget_set_opacity.

* GtkIconTheme gained asynchronous loaders for GtkIconInfo objects

* GtkIconInfo has changed from being a boxed type to a GObject. This
  is technically an ABI change, but basically all existing code
  will keep working if its used as a boxed type, and its not
  possible to instantiate GtkIconInfos outside Gtk, so this is not
  expected to be a big problem.

* Bugs fixed:
 590325 gtkbuilder needs a public policy about extension name
 673243 GtkRadioMenuItem accelerators no longer appear
 681578 gtk-demo: demo.ui is outdated
 683311 Leak in GtkIconViewAccessible
 685460 Add frame synchronization to GTK+

 692728 wayland evet source doesn't handle poll err/hup
 693251 wayland: fix the direction of scrolling
 693253 wayland: remove debug message
 693256 wayland: use the GdkCursorType enum information to lookup the cursor name
 693257 wayland: avoid returning NULL when getting a cursor
 693313 Improve tooltip support
 693338 wayland: skip pointer and keyboard events without a surface
 693400 gtkcellrenderertext: Sink floating entry before using as signal argument
 693709 Hide recently used if it is turned off in the control center
 693724 Add a gtk-recent-files-enabled GtkSetting
 693802 Add async GtkIconInfo loaders
 693912 wayland: look further through the hierarchy for the surface with the grab
 693913 wayland: attempt to determine the possible parent surface for popups
 693934 Add gdk_frame_clock_begin/end_updating()
 694022 GtkViewport: annotate the adjustment args of the constructor
 694075 GtkAccelLabel: Don't show "+" if there's no more keys to add
        Added scroll and touch events to GtkToolPalette

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.7.6
=================================

* We now use state flags for text direction: GTK_STATE_FLAG_LTR/RTL.
  gtk_style_context_set_direction() has been deprecated.

* We install headers for accessible implementations of GTK+ widgets.
  This makes it possible to implement accessibility for third-party
  widgets by subclassing the proper GTK+ implementation. To do this,
  include gtk/gtk-a11y.h.

* Invisible widgets now return a size of 0x0. This is an experimental
  change that makes GtkWidget::visible essentially behave the same way
  that "display: none" does in CSS. If you want the effect of CSS's
  "visibility: hidden", you can use a GtkNotebook with an empty page.

* GtkFrame now draws a background.

* The Broadway backend now installs a separate server: broadwayd.

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.7.4
=================================

* GtkBuilder now lets you refer to external objects from a ui
  file if the objects have been exported with the new function
  gtk_builder_expose_object()

* Font handling has been improved:
 - The default font is no longer handled like a custom style sheet
   that overrides everything, but as the initial value. This is the
   same behavior as in web browsers.
 - It is now possible to set font-family and font-size like other
   CSS properties, and relative font sizes are supported. Font
   sizes in CSS can be specified as numbers or with keywords
   like xx-small, medium, smaller, larger,...

* GTK+ now uses proper Unicode ellipses in strings.

* The releases includes several noticable performance improvements:
 - Size allocation has been optimized, by avoiding excessive
   resizing in various situations.
 - The performance of size groups has been improved.
 - Text rendering in GtkLabel and other widgets has been optimized
   to avoid excessive recreation of Pango layouts.
 - Icon loading overhead was reduced by caching of GtkIconInfo.
 - The CSS is now keeping a tree of selectors to speed up matchinh.

* Deprecations and removals:
 - Custom CSS properties have been deprecated
 - Support for color schemes has been removed
 - gtk_style_provider_get_style, gtk_style_provider_get_icon_factory
 - GtkGradient and GtkSymbolicColor
 - All the padding style properties in menus

* Bugs closed:

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.3.6
=================================

* GtkApplication has grown support for exporting application
  menus and menubars on the bus, as a GMenuModel. The
  new GtkApplicationWindow toplevel automatically
  displays these menu models when needed.

* GtkSpinButtons have received a long-overdue face-lift
  to make them easier to use with both mouse and touch.

* GtkScale has gained a has-origin property to request
  filled-in drawing of the trough.

* GtkWindow can now request that the window manager hide
  the titlebar when the window is maximized.

* The GtkTreeView accessibility support and the core
  treeview code have been extensively refactored;
  performance should be much improved. But watch out
  for regressions.

* The GtkFileChooser entry completion code has been
  extensively refactored; it now uses GtkEntryCompletion

* Excessive dependencies have been culled from Requires:
  lines in pc files. Dependent modules may have to declare
  dependencies that they were getting 'for free' in the past.

   have been implemented

* Win32 improvements:
 - Theming of column headers, radio buttons and menuitems,
   notebook tabs, etc has been fixed

  the various image properties are no longer used

* GtkTextView can now handle RGBA colors

* GtkFileChooser now remembers the last opened directory

* GtkLockButton is a new widget to control dialogs with
  PolicyKit (or other) permissions

* Size allocation changes:
 - GtkPaned and GtkMenuBar now do height-for-width
 - GtkAccelLabel is smarter about hiding the accel if too small
 - GTK+ now warns if widgets are under-allocated; this
   may cause considerable noise, it will be turned off
   before the next stable release
 - Label size allocation has been reworked, check your labels
 - No longer try to guess the size of labels; this makes
   it more important to give windows reasonable default
   sizes or set width-chars/max-width-chars on labels
 - The computation of initial window size has been reworked,
   check your windows

* A test framework for mozilla-style reftests has been added

* GDK Broadway backend changes:
 - Improved key event handling
 - Make resize grips work
 - Make window close buttons work
 - Stream data over websocket

* Bugs fixed:

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.1.2
=================================

* Theming fixes and enhancements
 - GtkNotebook has an initial-gap style property
 - GtkNotebook tab drawing fixes
 - Fix problems with transparent backgrounds in panel applets
 - Style classes for 'inline' and 'primary' toolbars and sidebars
 - Dark theme information is made available to window managers via
   the _GTK_THEME_VARIANT property
 - Improved rendering of insensitive text
 - Support non-uniform border withs in the default engine
 - Fix prelight on treeview expanders
 - Make it possible to give combo boxes, buttons, entries a
   uniform height

* GtkEntry supports 'hinting'

* GtkExpander can resize toplevel windows when expanding

* GtkGrid supports RTL flipping

* GtkStatusIcon reads the _NET_SYSTEM_TRAY_ICON_SIZE property
  to get information about the preferred icon size

* To help with debugging of rendering problems, GDK consults
  the GDK_RENDERING environment variable. Possible values include
  'similar', 'image' and 'recording'

* Fix some problems with XI2 and input methods

* New, experimental GDK backends:
 - broadway, which targets HTML5
 - wayland, which targets the wayland display server
 To build these backends, use the --enable-broadway-backend
 and --enable-wayland-backend configure options.
 To use them at runtime, set the GDK_BACKEND environment variable
 to 'broadway' or 'wayland'. Other backend-specific setup may
 still be required, such as running a wayland server.
