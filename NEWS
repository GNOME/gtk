Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.19.6
==================================

* CSS changes:
 - CSS margins, border and padding are more consistently supported
 - More widgets support min-width and min-height
 - More style properties have been superseded by CSS properties
 - Pseudo state names have been aligned with what CSS uses:
   :disabled instead of :insensitive, :indeterminate instead of
   :inconsistent and :drop(active) instead of :dnd. The old names
   still work
 - GTK+ specific CSS properties have been prefixed with -gtk-.
   The old names still work
 - The CSS syntax for Radial gradients is now supported
 - CSS documentation has been rewritten and expanded

* Themes:
 - GTK+ now includes a HighContrastInverse theme which is a dark
   variant of the HighContrast theme

 - Force a grab cursor while a popup is shown

* Bugs fixed:

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.19.5
==================================

* GtkShortcutsWindow:
 - GtkShortcutsGesture has been removed, since GtkShortcutsShortcut
   can now document gestures

* GtkFileChooser:
 - The places view now shows the available space when that information
   is available

 - More of the DND implementation is now handled in GDK: creating the
   drag window, moving the window along with the cursor, the drag
   cancel animation.
 - GdkSeat is a new API that supersedes grabs on individual devices and
   is a better fit for backends like Wayland or Mir

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.19.4
==================================

* GtkPopover can now be instructed to stay within the toplevel window
  on platforms that don't already enforce this (such as Wayland)
 
* Wayland:
 - Memory leak fixes
 - Window positioning and sizing fixes
 - Clipboard and DND fixes
 - New build dependency: wayland-protocols

* CSS changes:

 - Active spinners are now :checked, not :active
 - A -gtk-icontheme property has been added
 - A -gtk-icon-palette has been added to allow recoloring symbolic icons
 - Drag highlighting uses the new :dnd pseudoclass

* DND:
 - Make drag highlighting themable

 - Change the handling of drag windows to work on Wayland. The drag window
   implementation has been moved to GDK, with the new function
   gdk_drag_context_get_drag_window
 - Non-toplevel widgets can be used as drag widgets

* Bugs fixed:

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.19.3
==================================

* Theming changes
 - Non-standard CSS properties have been renamed to have a -gtk-
   prefix (the old names still work, with a warning):
     gtk-key-bindings is now -gtk-key-bindings
     icon-shadow is now -gtk-icon-shadow
 - CSS parsing errors and warnings are shown in the inspector

* GtkShortcutsWindow:
 - Widgets are more complete, to allow supporting them in glade
 - GtkShortcutsShortcut can now show gestures as well, GtkShortcutsGesture
   is no longer needed and will be removed soon
 - GtkShortcutsShortcut supports standard gestures, with predefined
   icons and subtitles

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.19.2
==================================

* Most widgets have been ported to CSS nodes. The element names and
  the tree relationships are documented now. The Adwaita and HighContrast
  themes have been mostly kept up-to-date with these changes. Third-party
  themes and custom CSS will need adjustments.

* The inspector now shows CSS nodes and allows to manipulate them.

* Size allocation has been simplified to avoid excessive resizes of
  the entire window.

* GtkShortcutsWindow can now display direction-dependent shortcuts
  and sequences of keys.

* Support for native file chooser on Win32 when using the new
  GtkFileChooserNative API, and when using GtkFileChooserButton.

* The GtkFileChooser interface prerequisite was changed from GtkWidget
  to GObject to allow non-widget filechooser implementations.

* :focus-on-click has been moved from various subclasses to GtkWidget,
  so it is now available for every widget, in particular GtkListBoxRow.

* Bugs fixed:
 735341 Fix/improve gtk_text_buffer_get_iter_at_*() functions

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.19.1
==================================

* Support for help overlays to document keyboard shortcuts and gestures
  has been added

* GdkAppLaunchContext is now setting the DISPLAY environment variable
  for X11

* Support for GL legacy profiles has been added back

* GTK+ now loads compose tables in the format used by XLib from
  ~/.config/gtk-3.0/Compose, ~/.XCompose and the X11 locale information

* GtkBuilder can now create GFile objects, for use in e.g. GFileIcons.

* New APIs:
 - GtkShortcutsWindow
 - gtk_text_tag_changed
 - gtk_settings_reset_property
 - gdk_rectangle_equal
 - gdk_gl_context_is_legacy

* A new commandline utility, gtk-query-settings, to query GTK+ settings,
  has been added

* Theming: Element names are now supported.
  A number of widgets have already been changed to use element names for
  the widget itself and its various subelements. This effort will continue
  in next development releases.
  This change will require adjustments in themes and custom css - as part of
  this transition, the element names and style classes in use are documented
  and will be stable going forward.

* Debugging: GtkInspector can now edit string-array-valued properties

* Wayland:
 - Fix transparent terminals
 - Fix treeview search popups

   changed the semantics of the get_frame_size() vfunc. GtkEntry
   subclasses that override this vfunc may need adjustment.

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.15.5
==================================

* GTK+ types now support the GLib g_autoptr() facility for
  automatic cleanup of automatic variables. GTK+ itself does
  not use g_autoptr() internally.

* GtkSearchEntry has gained ::next-match, ::previous-match
  and ::stop-search signals and a gtk_search_entry_handle_event()
  function, which help in providing a richer search experience
  and make search entries usable outside of GtkSearchBar.

* GtkFileChooser:
 - The search has been reintegrated in the UI, there is now
   a toggle button on the header bar to go to search mode,
   in addition to the Alt-S shortcut.
 - The file chooser button now accepts files by drag-and-drop properly.

* GtkScrolledWindow has gained a new ::edge-reached signal, which
  triggers when the edge of the scrollable area is reached.

* CSS:
 - Performance improvements

* OpenGL:
 - It is now possible to specify the required GL version, as well
   as some other options (debug, forward compatible) when creating
   a GdkGLContext
 - Support for the OpenGL legacy profile has been dropped. Most examples
   have been updated, with the exception of gdkgears, which will be fixed
   in the next snapshot
 - Use shader version 1.50

* Mir backend: Many improvements

   ::extend-selection signal
 - Selection can now be extended by scrolling

* GtkApplication:
 - Use app menu fallback with ssh connections
 - Provide a mechanism to hide unnecessary app menu items
   on OS X, so a single menu file can be used across platforms

 - Show other months in a different color under Adwaita again
 - Ensure we always show a bit of the other month on both ends

* GtkScrolledWindow
 - Make overlay scrollbars more dynamic

* GtkFileChooser:
 - Make bookmark DND insert at the right location
 - Make '~' and '/' work in recent mode
 - Make Ctrl-L work in recent mode

 - Performance improvements
 - Reduced memory consumption

* GtkInspector:
 - Add a magnifier for the selected widget

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.11.4 to 3.11.5
============================================

* GtkPopover: A new widget that is can be used for transient
  views, as an alternative to menus or dialogs.

* Dialogs:
 - Dialogs have been modernized, can use a header bar now
 - Built-in dialogs react to a setting, gtk-dialogs-use-header
   for this, dialogs derived from GtkDialog: default to no headerbar
 - GtkAssistant also respects the setting

* OS X:
 - Better menu integration. Items such as 'Hide', 'Hide Others'
   and 'Show All' are now handled specially
 - GTK+ provides a default application menu now

* Theming:
 - GTK+ now uses RGBA visuals by default
 - Notebook tabs now support a prelight state
 - Reorderable notebook tabs can be themed differently

* Documentation:
 - The API documentation has seen numerous fixes and improvements
 - Docbook markup is being phased out in favor of markdown

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.11.3 to 3.11.4
============================================

* GtkActionBar: A new container, which has a centered
  child like GtkHeaderBar. It can be used in places
  where header bar theming is not suitable

* GtkAppChooser: The online support has been simplified
  and modernized 

* GtkHeaderBar button theming has been changed to be
  more flexible. There is now a gtk-decoraton-layout
  setting and a decoration-layout property.

* Accessibility:
  - Links in labels are now accessible
  - Model-based menus are accessible
  - Accessible roles of several widgets have been fixed
  - GtkColorChooser accessibility is improved

* Theming: The Raleigh theme has been updated for
  several new features, including client-side decorations

  on items that allows them to be hidden on various
  conditions

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.11.0 to 3.11.1
============================================

* Theming:
 - A number of containers have been changed to draw
   backgrounds and borders. By default these are fully
   transparent, so nothing should change:
   GtkBox GtkFixed GtkGrid GtkEventBox
 - Link colors are not rendered using the :visited and :link
   states instead of the link-color and visited-link-color
   style properties

* Broadway:
 - Use client-side decorations
 - Implement window movement, raise/lower
 - Use rolling hashes for optimizing scrolling
 - Use click-to-focus
 - Support touch events
 - Support IPad on-screen keyboard

* GtkFileChooser:
 - Respect local-only in the places sidebar
 - Filter out duplicate application shortcuts
 - Show unmounted bookmarks

* GtkProgressBar:
 - Activity mode is now using a tick callback to move the block
   smoothly

* GtkWindow:
 - Fix size allocation for the fallback menubar
 - Improve application menu fallback if we have client-side
   decorations or a header bar

* GtkBuilder:
 - No longer requires every object to have an id

* Bugs fixed:

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.10 to 3.11.0
==========================================

* New notebook tab styling: GtkNotebook now offers a way
  for themes to opt out of the tab rendering, with the
  'has-tab-gap' style property. The Adwaita theme is using
  this to achieve a more modern tab appearance.

* GtkFlowBox: A container that its children in a reflowing
  grid, which can be oriented horizontally or vertically.
  It is similar to GtkListBox in that the children can
  be sorted and filtered, and by requiring a dedicated child
  widget type, GtkFlowBoxChild. It is similar to GtkTreeView
  in that is supports a full set of selection modes, including
  rubberband selection.

* GtkStack: children can now indicate that they require
  attention by setting the needs-attention child property.

* Broadway now requires binary array buffers and modern WebSocket
  protocol support

* Autoscrolling in range widgets has been improved to work more
  reliably in maximized windows.

* GtkSpinner has been changed to render in in a limited set of
  sizes.

* GtkApplication now stores and handles accelerators for GActions
  itself.

* GtkIconTheme now falls back to the gnome icontheme to fix
  problems with the availability of symbolic icons in other
  icon themes.

* GTK+ respects the deprecated gtk-button-images and gtk-menu-images
  settings again.

* Bugs fixed:

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.9.6 to 3.9.8
==========================================

* We've started deprecating GtkStock apis. These apis will continue
  working until GTK+ 4, so there is no need to rush to replace them.
  For more information, see
  https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gtk-devel-list/2013-July/msg00000.html
  Wholly deprecated as part of this effort:
  GtkIconFactory, GtkIconSet, GtkIconSource, GtkImageMenuItem,
  GtkAction, GtkUIManager

* The GtkSettings cleanup that was discussed at the recent GTK+
  hackfest has started to land. A number of settings have been
  deprecated and are ignored now:
  gtk-button-images,
  gtk-show-unicode-menu,
  gtk-show-input-method-menu,
  gtk-enable-mnemonics,
  gtk-auto-mnemonics,
  gtk-color-palette,
  gtk-can-change-accels,
  cursor blink settings,
  gtk-fallback-icon-theme,
  gtk-scrolled-window-placement,
  menu popup delay settings,
  gtk-menu-bar-accel,
  keynav tweaks,
  gtk-touchscreen-mode,
  gtk-icon-sizes,
  im style tweaks,
  gtk-file-chooser-backend,
  gtk-enable-tooltips,
  gtk-visible-focus,
  tooltip timeout tweaks,
  toolbar style tweaks

* Initial support for scaled output (on high-dpi screens) has been
  added. While this can be built with cairo 1.12, it needs a cairo
  branch to work. Support for this has been added to the Wayland,
  OS X and Windows backends.

* Bugs fixed:

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.9.2 to 3.9.4
==========================================

* GtkSearchBar: a toolbar that will popup automatically when
  searches should be started, and dismissed when they are finished

* GtkListBox a vertical container that can sort and filter its
  children

* GtkStack has gained position dependent transitions (left-right
  and up-down)

* The Broadway GDK backend can be built on Windows now

* Bugs fixed:

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.9.0 to 3.9.2
==========================================

* The GDK initialization code has been refactored. GdkDisplayManager
  is no longer backend-specific.

* The symbol exporting functionality has been refactored. We no longer
  use .symbols files, and instead rely on explicit header annotations
  for every exported symbol. the abicheck scripts are no longer used.

* The GDK drawing and scrolling has been simplified. We no longer use
  XCopyArea for scrolling, instead an offscreen cache is used. There
  is a new debug flag, GTK_DEBUG=pixel-cache for this.

* Window sizing issues have been addressed.

* Implement height-for-width for GtkEventBox and GtkCheckButton

* Custom titlebars can now be set from GtkBuilder files

* Optionally install tests, when configured with --enable-installed-tests.
  To run these tests, gnome-desktop-testing-runner can be used.

* Native input methods are supported on OS X now.

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.7 to 3.9
======================================

* GtkFileChooser:
 - Always show fuse-mounted locations in shortcuts
 - GtkFileChooserButton has received a lot of fixes and tests have
   been added for many of them

* GtkWindow:
 - Initial support for client-side decorations has been added. This
   is going to be used by default under Wayland. To try it with other
   backends, set the GTK_CSD=1 environment variable.
 - gtk_window_set_titlebar: A new function that can set a custom,
   client-side titlebar on toplevel windows.

* Wayland:
 - Use client-side decorations
 - Implement maximization
 - Improve cursor handling
 - Improve multi-monitor handling
 - Support most GtkSettings (for now by reading GSettings directly)
 - Complete the keymap implementation
 - Add support for custom surfaces
 - Implement animated cursors
 - Support the WAYLAND_SOCKET environment variable
 - Implement frame synchronizatio
 - Document Wayland-specific APIs

* Broadway:
 - Improve window size handling
 - Implement frame synchronization
 - Add support for password authentication

* New APIs, widgets, feature additions:
 - GtkHeaderBar is a new widget similar to a GtkBox, with the extra
   feature that it can center a child (typically a title), independent
   of the other content.
 - GtkPlacesSidebar is the sidebar widget in the file chooser, exported
   as a public widget - it will be shared with nautilus.
 - GtkStack is an alternative to GtkNotebook for showing one of several
   child widgets at a time. It supports animated transitions. Tabs are
   not built into this widgets, but instead provided by the separate
   GtkStackSwitcher widget.
 - GtkRevealer is a new new widget that can hide or show its child
   in an animated fashion.
 - GtkMenuTracker is a helper object that makes dealing with
   GMenuModels easier and more efficient.
 - gtk_grid_remove_row/column: New functions to remove whole rows
   or columns from a GtkGrid
 - Support for composite children has been added to GtkWidget. This
   allows to create complex widgets from GtkBuilder ui files. All
   complex GTK+ widgets have been converted to use this facility.
 - Baseline support was added to the GTK+ size allocation machinery.
   Widgets can now export the baseline of the text they contain,
   and containers can align their children wrt to their baselines.


* Known problems, feature removals, compatibility caveats:
 - Handling of window size is currently in flux, and there are
   some known problems with sizes unintentionally changing
 - Support for the Motif DND protocol has been dropped
 - Client-side decorations still have some issues when drawing
   directly on toplevel windows or setting their background
 - Support for multiple screens per display has been removed. This
   was only ever supported on X11, and is an exceedingly rare setup
   nowadays. The display-screen relation is now 1:1, and we will do
   some more simplification of displaymanager/display/screen/monitor
   APIs.
 - gdk_window_get_display has been deprecated
 - gtk_widget_push_composite_child has been deprecated - this was
   used for anything
 - GtkSwitch has been changed to draw focus internally, instead of
   reserving space outside the switch for it. This may require some
   application adjustment where margins were tweaked to 'correct'
   the alignment of switches manually

* Printing:
 - Avoid blocking when looking for avahi printers
 - Don't link against avahi-gobject, use D-Bus directly

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.7.10
==================================

* We now support the Window Manager frame synchronization protocol draft (when
  running under a WM that supports it). This means applications will throttle
  their drawing cycle to what the compositor is drawing, and the compositor
  will never render half-updated windows, for seamless resizing and improved
  smoothness in drawing.
  See https://mail.gnome.org/archives/wm-spec-list/2013-January/msg00000.html
  and the articles at http://blog.fishsoup.net/ for more details.

* We now support setting an opacity to any GtkWidget, not just toplevels:
  gtk_window_set_opacity has been deprecated in favor of gtk_widget_set_opacity.

* GtkIconTheme gained asynchronous loaders for GtkIconInfo objects

* GtkIconInfo has changed from being a boxed type to a GObject. This
  is technically an ABI change, but basically all existing code
  will keep working if its used as a boxed type, and its not
  possible to instantiate GtkIconInfos outside Gtk, so this is not
  expected to be a big problem.

* Bugs fixed:
 590325 gtkbuilder needs a public policy about extension name
 673243 GtkRadioMenuItem accelerators no longer appear
 681578 gtk-demo: demo.ui is outdated
 683311 Leak in GtkIconViewAccessible
 685460 Add frame synchronization to GTK+
 687842 Support partially transparent widgets
 690247 multiple context in a immodule can't be selected

 692728 wayland evet source doesn't handle poll err/hup
 693251 wayland: fix the direction of scrolling
 693253 wayland: remove debug message
 693256 wayland: use the GdkCursorType enum information to lookup the cursor name
 693257 wayland: avoid returning NULL when getting a cursor
 693313 Improve tooltip support
 693338 wayland: skip pointer and keyboard events without a surface
 693400 gtkcellrenderertext: Sink floating entry before using as signal argument
 693709 Hide recently used if it is turned off in the control center
 693724 Add a gtk-recent-files-enabled GtkSetting
 693802 Add async GtkIconInfo loaders
 693912 wayland: look further through the hierarchy for the surface with the grab
 693913 wayland: attempt to determine the possible parent surface for popups
 693934 Add gdk_frame_clock_begin/end_updating()
 694022 GtkViewport: annotate the adjustment args of the constructor
 694075 GtkAccelLabel: Don't show "+" if there's no more keys to add
        Added scroll and touch events to GtkToolPalette

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.7.6
=================================

* We now use state flags for text direction: GTK_STATE_FLAG_LTR/RTL.
  gtk_style_context_set_direction() has been deprecated.

* We install headers for accessible implementations of GTK+ widgets.
  This makes it possible to implement accessibility for third-party
  widgets by subclassing the proper GTK+ implementation. To do this,
  include gtk/gtk-a11y.h.

* Invisible widgets now return a size of 0x0. This is an experimental
  change that makes GtkWidget::visible essentially behave the same way
  that "display: none" does in CSS. If you want the effect of CSS's
  "visibility: hidden", you can use a GtkNotebook with an empty page.

* GtkFrame now draws a background.

* The Broadway backend now installs a separate server: broadwayd.

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.7.4
=================================

* GtkBuilder now lets you refer to external objects from a ui
  file if the objects have been exported with the new function
  gtk_builder_expose_object()

* Font handling has been improved:
 - The default font is no longer handled like a custom style sheet
   that overrides everything, but as the initial value. This is the
   same behavior as in web browsers.
 - It is now possible to set font-family and font-size like other
   CSS properties, and relative font sizes are supported. Font
   sizes in CSS can be specified as numbers or with keywords
   like xx-small, medium, smaller, larger,...

* GTK+ now uses proper Unicode ellipses in strings.

* The releases includes several noticable performance improvements:
 - Size allocation has been optimized, by avoiding excessive
   resizing in various situations.
 - The performance of size groups has been improved.
 - Text rendering in GtkLabel and other widgets has been optimized
   to avoid excessive recreation of Pango layouts.
 - Icon loading overhead was reduced by caching of GtkIconInfo.
 - The CSS is now keeping a tree of selectors to speed up matchinh.

* Deprecations and removals:
 - Custom CSS properties have been deprecated
 - Support for color schemes has been removed
 - gtk_style_provider_get_style, gtk_style_provider_get_icon_factory
 - GtkGradient and GtkSymbolicColor
 - All the padding style properties in menus

* Bugs closed:

=================================

* GtkApplication has grown support for exporting application
  menus and menubars on the bus, as a GMenuModel. The

  performance should be much improved. But watch out
  for regressions.

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.1.4
=================================

* GtkAssistant has received a visual refresh; as a side-effect,
  the various image properties are no longer used

* GtkTextView can now handle RGBA colors

* GtkFileChooser now remembers the last opened directory

* GtkLockButton is a new widget to control dialogs with
  PolicyKit (or other) permissions

* Size allocation changes:
 - GtkPaned and GtkMenuBar now do height-for-width
 - GtkAccelLabel is smarter about hiding the accel if too small
 - GTK+ now warns if widgets are under-allocated; this
   may cause considerable noise, it will be turned off
   before the next stable release
 - Label size allocation has been reworked, check your labels
 - No longer try to guess the size of labels; this makes
   it more important to give windows reasonable default
   sizes or set width-chars/max-width-chars on labels
 - The computation of initial window size has been reworked,
   check your windows

* A test framework for mozilla-style reftests has been added

* GDK Broadway backend changes:
 - Improved key event handling
 - Make resize grips work
 - Make window close buttons work
 - Stream data over websocket

* Bugs fixed:

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 3.1.2
=================================

* Theming fixes and enhancements
 - GtkNotebook has an initial-gap style property
 - GtkNotebook tab drawing fixes
 - Fix problems with transparent backgrounds in panel applets
 - Style classes for 'inline' and 'primary' toolbars and sidebars
 - Dark theme information is made available to window managers via
   the _GTK_THEME_VARIANT property
 - Improved rendering of insensitive text
 - Support non-uniform border withs in the default engine
 - Fix prelight on treeview expanders
 - Make it possible to give combo boxes, buttons, entries a
   uniform height

* GtkEntry supports 'hinting'

* GtkExpander can resize toplevel windows when expanding

* GtkGrid supports RTL flipping

* GtkStatusIcon reads the _NET_SYSTEM_TRAY_ICON_SIZE property
  to get information about the preferred icon size

* To help with debugging of rendering problems, GDK consults
  the GDK_RENDERING environment variable. Possible values include
  'similar', 'image' and 'recording'

* Fix some problems with XI2 and input methods

* New, experimental GDK backends:
 - broadway, which targets HTML5
 - wayland, which targets the wayland display server
 To build these backends, use the --enable-broadway-backend
 and --enable-wayland-backend configure options.
 To use them at runtime, set the GDK_BACKEND environment variable
 to 'broadway' or 'wayland'. Other backend-specific setup may
 still be required, such as running a wayland server.

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 2.99.3
==================================

* This release adds some forgotten padding to class structs,
  and thus breaks ABI for a last time before 3.0

* Many Introspection annotation improvements

* We no longer build the gtk-update-icon-cache utility, and
  use a preexisting one, if --enable-gtk2-dependency is passed
  to configure

* GtkBuilder can now fill GtkComboBoxText and GtkMenToolButton
  widgets with data, as well as GtkFileFilters and GtkTextTagTables

* GtkImage now has a ::use-fallback property to allow generic
  fallback with GIcons and icon-names (e.g. for symbolic icons)

* There's a new gtk_text_view_get_cursor_locations() to enable
  popup-at-cursor functionality

* The application chooser widgets can now set a custom
  dialog heading

* The file chooser and application chooser widgets have received
  minor visual improvements

* gtk-auto-mnemonics is now backed by an XSetting

* Defaults for GtkSettings, as well as theme-specific settings,
  are now read from key files

* Key themes are now supported again, their syntax has been changed
  to be CSS-like

* More objects use GtkStyleContext directly now:
  GtkTreeView
  GtkIconView
  GtkCellArea
  GtkCellRendererText
  GtkCellRendererPixbuf
  GtkCellRendererAccel
  GtkCellRendererProgress

* GtkPlug and GtkSocket have been reduced to X11-specific API, and
  using them requires including the <gtk/gtkx.h> header, and uses
  of GdkNativeWindow in their APIs have been replaced by the X11
  Window type.
  A number of other API changes were necessary in GDK to ensure
  that multiple GDK backends can coexist:
  - GdkNativeWindow has been dropped
  - The GdkEventOwnerChange owner field is a GdkWindow now
  - The GdkEventSelection requestor field is a GdkWindow now
  - The GtkWidget::client_event vfunc is gone
  - GdkEventClient is gone, together with related API:
    gdk_add_client_message_filter
    gdk_display_add_client_message_filter
    gdk_screen_broadcast_client_message
    gdk_event_send_client_message
    gdk_event_send_client_message_for_display
    gdk_event_send_clientmessage_toall
  - gdk_drag_get_protocol_for_display has been changed to
    gdk_window_get_drag_protocol

* Migration guide and tutorial and other documentation improvements

Overview of Changes from GTK+ 2.91.7 to 2.99.0
==============================================

* Deprecations and removals:
 - Long-obsolete linuxfb-related GtkWindow APIs have been dropped
 - All remaining G_SEALed struct members have been removed
 - GtkThemeEngine has been removed
 - gdk_display_get_window_at_device_position() has been renamed to
   gdk_device_get_window_at_position()
 - gdk_display_get_device_state() has been renamed to
   gdk_device_get_position()
 - gdk_device_set_source() has been dropped
 - gdk_set_pointer_hooks(), gdk_display_set_pointer_hooks() and
   gdk_display_set_device_hooks() have been removed
 - The deprecated GtkNotebook:tab-pack child property has been removed
 - The deprecated gtk_quit_add() functions have been removed
 - The GtkRange update-policy facility has been removed

* The gtk-update-icon-cache and gtk-builder-convert utilities have
  been renamed back to their un-suffixed names. Distributions will
  have to resolve the conflict between GTK+ 2.x and 3.0 packages
  by dropping one set of the utilities and adding a dependency.

* It is now possible to include multiple GDK backends in a single
  library. The --with-gdk-backend option has been split into separate
  --enable-{x11,win32,quartz}-backend options.

* The GDK Quartz backend has been ported to the new GDK backend API

* A number of widgets have been ported to use GtkStyleContext directly:
  GtkAccelLabel, GtkArrow, GtkSeparator, GtkSpinButton, GtkMessageDialog,
  GtkFrame, GtkEventBox, GtkScrolledWindow, GtkProgressBar, GtkEntry,
  GtkFileChooserEntry, GtkSwitch, GtkHandleBox, GtkToolbar, GtkFixed,
  GtkToolPalette, GtkAboutDialog, GtkAssistant, GtkTrayIcon, GtkPaned,
  GtkToolButton, GtkSocket, GtkRecentChooser, GtkTooltip, GtkPathBar,
  GtkWin32EmbedWidget, GtkCellView, GtkDialog, GtkDrawingArea, GtkPlug,
  GtkEntryCompletion, GtkFileChooserButton, GtkFileChooser, GtkHandleBox,
  GtkLinkButton, GtkOffscreenWindow

* Various problems with width-for-height geometry management have been
  fixed in GtkAlignment, GtkCheckButton, GtkBin

* The GtkComboBox, GtkIconView and GtkCellView widgets have been ported
  to use GtkCellArea for their cell layouts

* The cups print backend can now send print jobs directly in PDF if
  cups supports it

* GtkNumerableIcon is a variant of GEmblemedIcon for using numbers
  as emblems

* Bugs fixed:

Overview of Changes from GTK+ 2.91.6 to 2.91.7
==============================================

* The treeview-refactor branch has been merged, bringing more
  flexible cell arrangement with GtkCellArea, GtkCellAreaBox, etc

* The gdk-backend branch has been merged. This branch cleans up the
  internal frontend/backend separation in GDK, with the ultimate goal
  of allowing to build a single gdk library that contains multiple
  backends (interesting combinations are x11+wayland or quartz+x11).

  For now, GDK is still restricted to a single backend, but
  as a first step, the libraries no longer include the backend name
  in their soname, but are just libgdk-3.0.so and libgtk-3.0.so.

  Only the x11 backend has been kept up to date with this cleanup
  work, other backends are broken in this release.

* Deprecations and removals:
 - G_SEALed struct members have been removed from GtkWindowGroup,
   GtkDrawingArea, GtkTreeStore, GtkTreeModelSort, GtkTreeSelection,
   GtkSocket, GtkPrintJob, GtkSelectionData
 - Input device handling:
   - gdk_display_list_devices, gdk_display_get_core_pointer,
     gdk_input_set_extension_events, gtk_widget_set_extension_events,
     gdk_devices_list have been removed
   - gdk_display_warp_device has been replaced by gdk_device_warp
   - gdk_enable_multidevice has been replaced by gdk_disable_multidevice
 - Drag-and-Drop:
   gdk_drag_context_new, gdk_drag_find_window and gdk_drag_get_protocol
   have been removed
 - Property handling:
   Functions that deal with X11-specific encodings such as Compound Text
   have been moved to backend-specific API:
   gdk_string_to_compound_text[_for_display],
   gdk_utf8_to_compound_text[_for_display], gdk_free_compound_text,
   gdk_text_property_to_text_list[_for_display], gdk_free_text_list,
   gdk_text_property_to_utf8_list
 - Foreign windows:
   Functions for dealing with GdkWindow wrappers around foreign
   windows have been moved to backend-specific API.
 - Application launching:
   The gdk_spawn_* APIs have been removed, since they were trivial
   wrappers around g_spawn_* on most platforms and can be replaced
   by GIO GAppInfo APIs.
 - Misc. other functions: gdk_net_wm_supports, gdk_set_locale,
   gdkx_visual_get have been either removed, gdk_set_sm_client_id
   has been moved to backend-specific API.

* A number of GTK+ widgets have been ported to use GtkStyleContext
  directly for rendering

* The tracker search backend for the file chooser has been updated
  to work with libtracker-sparql as available in tracker >= 0.9

* The GtkAboutDialog has been given a facelift. It no longer
  opens second-level dialogs

* The GDK X11 backend now uses XI2 (including multi-device capabilities)
  by default. Use gdk_disable_multidevice() to switch back to the
  XI1/Core implementation

* Bug fixes:
 629923 Consider always calling unmap() when unsetting MAPPED flag

Overview of Changes from GTK+ 2.91.5 to 2.91.6
==============================================

* Deprecations, cleanups and API changes:
 - GdkDrawable and some X11-specific APIs have been removed
 - GtkStyle and GtkRcStyle have been deprecated
 - The GdkWindowClass enumeration is now GdkWindowWindowClass
 - gdk_window_get_geometry lost its depth argument
 - The old, unused gtk_decorated_window_... functions have
   been removed.

* GtkComboBox has gained an 'active id' property that is
  intended for easy binding to settings

* GtkAppChooser: A new family of widgets that allow choosing
  an application to open a file. This is strongly based on
  the corresponding nautilus dialog, which it is replacing.

* The GtkStyleContext branch has been merged, changing the APIs
  that are used to do themed drawing, and the theme engine interfaces.
  Among the new classes are GtkStyleContext (replacing GtkStyle) and
  GtkCssProvider (replacing the gtkrc parser). The migration guide
  contains a chapter about porting from GtkStyle to GtkStyleContext.

Overview of Changes from GTK+ 2.91.0 to 2.91.1
==============================================

* GTK+ can now add a resize grip to any window. The resize
  grip functionality in GtkStatusbar has been removed.

* A very old bug in the handling of geometry widgets has
  been fixed, and a way to set geometry in terms of the
  geometry widget has been added: gtk_window_resize_to_geometry()

* The GtkFileChooser now uses GSettings to store its settings
  instead of the keyfile ~/.config/gtk-2.0/gtkfilechooser.ini

* GtkWrapBox has been dropped from GTK+ again. The widget
  will be available in libegg until clear use cases have
  been established.

* GtkWidget now has horizontal and vertical expand flags, in
  the form of ::hexpand and ::vexpand properties. These flags
  are intended to obsolete most custom container-specific
  expand child properties, over time.
  Expandability is inherited up the widget hierarchy.

* GtkComboBoxEntry has been deprecated in favor of a
  ::has-entry property on GtkComboBox.

* The GtkComboBox text convenience API (gtk_combo_box_new_text(), etc)
  has been deprecated in favor of a new GtkComboBoxText class.

* GtkLinkButton has gained a ::activate-link signal that
  can be used to suppress the default behavior.

* The very outdated tutorial has been dropped from the GTK+ distribution,
  and a new 'Getting started' section has been added to the API
  documentation that will accumulate tutorial material over time.

* Bugs fixed:

Overview of Changes from GTK+ 2.90.7 to 2.91.0
==============================================

* The rendering cleanup work has landed. This is a large change that
  affects many APIs.
  - All gtkstyle functions have been changed to take a cairo_t argument
    instead of a window + area.
  - GdkPixmap is gone. APIs that took pixmaps are being replaced by ones
    that take pixbufs or cairo surfaces, or regions (where pixmaps were
    used as masks). In background handling, pixmaps have been replaced
    by cairo patterns, see gdk_window_set_background_pattern().
  - GdkColormap is gone. It is replaced by visuals, see
    gtk_widget_set_visual().
  - The ::expose-event signal on GtkWidget has been replaced by a
    ::draw signal.
  - gtk_widget_get_snapshot() has been removed. Instead, gtk_widget_draw()
    can render a widget onto an cairo_t.

* The GtkSizeRequest interface has been merged into GtkWidget, and
  GtkCellSizeRequest has been merged into GtkCellRenderer. The wrapper
  functions have been renamed to include 'preferred', e.g
  gtk_size_request_get_width() is now gtk_widget_get_preferred_width()
  and gtk_cell_size_request_get_width_for_height() is now
  gtk_cell_renderer_get_preferred_width_for_height().

* GtkObject has been removed. The ::destroy signal has been moved
  to GtkWidget. At the same time, GtkWidgetFlags have been removed,
  they already had getters and setters anyway.

* GtkWidget has gained generic alignment and padding properties:
  halign, valign, margin-left, margin-right, margin-top, margin-bottom
  These can be used instead of container-specific child properties or
  GtkMisc and GtkAlignment widgets.

* Container widgets can now let GTK+ handle border-width for them, using
  gtk_container_class_handle_border_width()

* The GtkEditableClass struct has been renamed to GtkEditableInterface

* Mouse wheel scrolling has been removed from GtkNotebook

* The default policy for scrolled windows has been changed to 'automatic'

* Global url hooks have been removed from GtkAboutDialog and GtkLinkButton

* The global window creation hook has been removed from GtkNotebook

* The error handling in GDK has been modernized and avoids synchronizing
  X requests as much as possible

* Fixed Bugs:
 323904 GtkEditable header is slightly incorrect
 339745 Return value of gtk_link_button_set_uri_hook not usable
 468672 GTK_POLICY_AUTOMATIC should be the default policy...

Overview of Changes from GTK+ 2.90.1 to 2.90.2
==============================================

* GtkApplication: an application class, based on GApplication. Currently,
  this is fairly minimal, but it is good enough already to replace libunique.
  Future work:
  - Add a way to say "This is my application menubar", which gets
    put into all toplevel windows on non-OS-X, and into the top
    on OS X
  - Support session management
  - Maybe support application settings

* Misc new api:
 - gtk_window_has_group: determines if a window is part of a window group
 - gtk_status_bar_remove_all: removes all messages from a statusbar

* DND on offscreen windows works now

* GtkIconView:
 - arrow keynav can now be connected over adjacent icon views

* GtkAssistant:
 - gtk_assistant_commits: prevents going back beyond a certain
   point in the page sequence, adjust shown buttons appropriately
 - It is now officially supported to have a progress page at the
   end of the page sequence

* Introspection:
 - Many annotation fixes
 - gdkx.h api is exported in a separate typelib, GdkX11-3.0

* Cleanups:
 - the draw_string function has been removed from GtkStyle
 - gdk_get/set_use_xshm have been removed
 - Deprecated gdk_color api has been removed

* Documentation related to GTK+ 1.2, etc has been removed. Instead
  there is an initial GTK+ 3 porting guide now.

* Bugs fixed:
 620509 Progress bar rendering is broken
 607628 DnD operation doesn't work when using offscreen.
 619838 kill off references to gtk 1.2 in docs/comments

Overview of Changes from GTK+ 2.90.0 to 2.90.1
==============================================

* Printing: The list of locales using US Letter papersize has
  been updated to match the CLDR 1.8.1

* The default location for the 'module cache' files (ie the files
  produced by gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders and gtk-query-immodules) has
  been changed to $libdir/gtk-3.0/3.0.0/{loaders,immodules}.cache.
  This should avoid multilib problems with the previous location.

  Additionally, the query utilities accept an --update-cache argument
  to update the cache file directly, instead of writing to stdout

* gtk_radio_action_join_group: A binding-friendly way to manage
  radio actions.

* GtkAdjustment enforces values to the range [lower, upper - page_size]

* GDK has been GSEALed, with the addition of suitable accessors

* The XI2 branch with better support for multiple input devices has
  been merged, together with backends for XInput, XInput2, win32 and
  Quartz, and corresponding updates to input-device handling code
  in GTK.

* A number of orientable widgets are no longer abstract: GtkBox,
  GtkButtonBox, GtkPaned, GtkRuler, GtkScale, GtkScrollbar, GtkSeparator.
  All of these can now be instantiated and flipped between horizontal
  and vertical orientation at runtime. Their H/V subclasses are still
  available, as convenience API.

* More deprecated API has been removed

* Bugs fixes:
 613132 GtkBoxChild should probably be deprecated
 592580 GDK needs sealing
 618870 GTK+ uses wrong pkg-config to reveal the CAIRO_PREFIX

  some applications, see
  617444 GNU emacs warnings with extended layout GTK+
  617556 inkscape toolbars broken with extended layout

* gtk_icon_theme_load_symbolic: Support for 'symbolic' icons

* Applications can indicate their preference for a dark theme
  variant by setting GtkSettings::gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme

* GtkTreeModelFilter can be more usefully subclassed

Overview of Changes from GTK+ 2.17.6 to 2.17.7
==============================================

* Client-side windows: a number of regressions related to embedding
  have been fixed

* Printing: The file backend supports SVG output

* Minor API additions:
 - GtkIconView gained an icon-padding property that can be used to fine-tune
   how much space each column needs
 - GtkTreeViewColumn grew a sort-column-id property that can be used to set
   up sort columns in GtkBuilder files
 - GdkWindow gained a cursor property and associated getter
 - GtkFileChooser has a create-folders property to allow disabling the

Overview of Changes from GTK+ 2.17.4 to 2.17.5
==============================================

* Client-side windows:
 - Quite a few fixes have happened for the win32 and directfb backends

* GSEAL:
 - Accessors have been added for sealed members in GtkCellRenderer and
   GtkWidget

* Changes that are relevant for distributors:
 - The jpeg2000 pixbuf loader is now optional. Pass --with-libjasper
   to configure to build it

* Bugs fixed

Overview of Changes from GTK+ 2.17.3 to 2.17.4
==============================================

* GtkEntry now has model-view separation, with GtkEntryBuffer.
  One intended use case for this is to support 'secure memory'
  for password entries.

* The print dialog can now optionally include the page setup
  controls, avoiding the need for a separate page setup dialog
  in many applications.

* Coloring of visited links in GtkLabel can now be turned off, with
  the ::track-visited-links property.

* Support for clipmasks in gdk_draw_pixbuf now works, this will
  introduce visual changes in code that uses clipmasks when drawing
  pixbufs. However, since this never worked that is unlikely to happen.
  Old code using gdk_pixbuf_render_threshold_alpha masks when rendering
  pixbufs will now produce truncated results at the edges.

* A number of regressions from the client-side window merge have
  been fixed.

* The directfb GDK backend has been fixed to build with csw.

* Bugs fixed:
 569393 gtk calendar localization YM note is wrong
 587559 Popup closes immediately
 551409 Print dialog should include page size and orientation

Overview of Changes from GTK+ 2.17.2 to 2.17.3
==============================================

* GtkFileChooser:
 - Shows the size column by default now

* GtkStatusIcon:
 - Has a title property, which can be used by ATs when they
   read status icons

* GtkInfoBar:
 - The default theme now includes color definitions for infobars
 - The ::use-tooltip-style style property has been removed

* GtkMountOperation now supports interaction during unmount operations.

* The client-side windows branch has been merged; GDK now maintains
  its own window hierarchy client-side, and only uses X windows where
  unavoidable. Some of the benefits of this change are
  - Reduced flicker
  - The ability to do transformed and animated rendering of widgets
  - Easier embedding of GTK+ widgets e.g. into Clutter scene graphs
  This is a fundamental change to the way GDK works, so watch out for
  regressions.

Overview of Changes from GTK+ 2.17.1 to 2.17.2
==============================================

* GtkInfoBar: A new widget to show a transient 'message area'
  inside a content pane. The API is similar to GtkDialog and
  supports theming for different message types (warnings,
  errors, etc)

* GtkFileChooser:
  - Improve path bar by ellipsizing long names and preventing
    vertical size changes
  - Backup files are now hidden by default
  - GTK+ remembers the file chooser sorting state now

* GtkButtonBox: Implements the GtkOrientable interface now.

* Printing:
 - GTK+ supports printing an application-defined 'selection' now,
   in addition to usual page ranges.

* Changes that are relevant for theme authors:
 - The new GtkInfoBar widget uses symbolic colors for theming
   its background color depending on the message type. By default,
   it uses the same background color as tooltips. This can be turned
   off with style property.
 - The GTK+ file chooser (as well as nautilus and other users of GIO
   icon information) can now show different icons for xdg user dirs.
   The icon names are folder-documents, folder-download, folder-music,
   folder-pictures, folder-publicshare, folder-templates, folder-videos,
   with an automatic fallback to the standard folder icon.

Overview of Changes from GTK+ 2.17.0 to 2.17.1
==============================================

* GtkLabel:
 - GtkLabel can show embedded URLs, much like SexyUrlLabel

* Printing:
 - GTK+ includes a print backend that works with the PAPI
   printing service.
 - The file and lpr backends can print multiple pages per sheet.

* Changes that are relevant for theme authors:

   style properties

Overview of Changes from GTK+ 2.15.2 to 2.15.3
==============================================

Overview of Changes from GTK+ 2.15.1 to 2.15.2
==============================================

* GtkAction:
 - Make toolitems pick up icon names from actions
 - Draw proxies of radio actions properly
 - Make menu proxies of recent actions work
 - Avoid accidental activations when changing actions on proxies
 - Make derived button classes work as proxies

* Input methods:
 - Avoid an assertion due to early use of input methods

* GtkScale:
 - Avoid a segfault in the marker drawing code

* GtkImageMenuItem:
 - Add a property to override the show-menu-images setting

* Bugs fixed:
 566628 gdk_display_close always asserts on win32 and quartz
 569240 Crasher when using markers
 569104 Toggle menu entries showed as check menu entries...
 322932 Always show icons on panel menus

* Updated translations:
 Finnish (fi)
 German (de)


Overview of Changes from GTK+ 2.15.0 to 2.15.1
==============================================

* GtkFileChooser:
 - Remember the file chooser's size across invocations
 - Handle uris that are entered in the entry
 - Improve autocompletion, in particular for uris

* GtkEntry:
 - New property "im-module" for selecting input methods per-widget
 - New icon-related API got renamed for consistency
 - Added properties and setters for icon tooltips

* GtkTextView:
 - New property "im-module" for selecting input methods per-widget
 - New signal "paste-done" to allow better handling of async pasting

* GtkScale:
 - New api to add annotated marks: gtk_scale_add_mark.

* GtkAction:
 - Rework the way actions and proxies interact, to make the
   interaction less ad hoc, more extensible, and better suited
   for support in GUI builders like glade.

   To be used as a proxy, a widget must now implement the
`  GtkActivatable interface, and GtkActivatable implementations
   are responsible for syncing their appearance with the action
   and for activating the action.

   All the widgets that are commonly used as proxies implement
   GtkActivatable now.

   This is a big change, and it is not unlikely to break some
   current users of GtkAction, so feedback about problems caused
   by this is appreciated.

 - Add a "gicon" property to specify the icon with a GIcon

* GDK:
 - On X11, GDK now caches cursors to avoid cursor theming overhead
 - New cursor type for blank cursors: GDK_BLANK_CURSOR

* New deprecations:
   gtk_scale_Button_get_orientation()
   gtk_scale_button_set_orientation()
   gtk_action_connect_proxy()
   gtk_action_disconnect_proxy()
   gtk_widget_get_action()
   gtk_action_block_activate_from()
   gtk_action_unblock_activate_from()
   direct access to "gtk-action" object data

* Changes that are relevant for translators:
 - Navigation and Media stock labels have separate message contexts now
 - The caps lock warning string has been changed

* Bugs fixed:

Overview of Changes from GTK+ 2.14.x to 2.15.0
==============================================

* GtkFileChooser
 - Optionally shows file sizes
 - Mounts volumes when necessary
 - Picks better mime icons

* GtkEntry
 - Can show icons at either side of the entry, which can be made
   clickable, drag sources, etc
 - Can show progress information
 - Picks the best available placeholder character for invisible entries 
   unless it is explicitly set. See the invisible-char-set property
 - Input methods work again in invisible entries
 - Invisible entries can optionally display a caps-lock warning. This
   can be turned off with the caps-lock-warning property

* GtkStatusIcon
 - Uses an extension of the tray icon spec to negotiate RGBA support.
   This is also supported by the GNOME panel. For details, see the
   section on "Visual and bckground pixmap handling" in the System
   Tray Protocol Specification.
 - Supports scroll events, middle clicks and rich tooltips

* GtkLinkButton
 - Respects user-defined tooltips 
 - Has a default url hook

* GtkBuilder
 - Can construct menus
 - Can associate accel groups with windows
 - Child properties can now be translatable, e.g. GtkAssistant::page-title

* GtkOrientable
 - A new interface implemented by all widgets that have horizontal and
   vertical variants

* Printing support
 - Print-to-file can save to non-local files
 - Page rendering can be deferred to a thread to avoid blocking the mainloop

* GDK
 - GdkKeymap emits a state-changed signal when the caps lock state changes

* Newly deprecated functions:
  gdk_window_get_toplevels(),
  gtk_font_selection_dialog_get_apply_button(),
  gtk_status_icon_set_tooltip(),
  gtk_toolbar_set_orientation()

* Changes that are relevant for theme authors
 - The GtkMenu::arrow-placement style property allow more space efficient
   layout of scrolling menus
 - Submenu arrows can be scaled relative to the font size, with the
   GtkMenuItem::arrow-scaling style property
 - Themes can set the GtkDialog::content-area-spacing style property to 
   change the spacing between elements of the content area
 - The GtkEntry::state-hint style property can be used to request that
   GTK+ should pass the correct state when drawing the background of entries
 - The GtkEntry::prelight style property can be used to suppress prelighting
   of icons in entries on mouseover
 
* Changes that are relevant for translators
 - GTK+ has been switched to use the two-argument C_() macro
   instead of Q_() for messages with context

Overview of Changes from GTK+ 2.8.x to 2.9.0
============================================

* GtkStatusIcon, a cross-platform "tray icon" API

* GtkAssistant, a widget for creating multi-step wizards

* GtkLinkButton, a widget that displays a clickable hyperlink

* GtkRecentChooser, widgets to display and select recently used files

* GtkPrintOperation, cross-platform printing support

* A framework for rich text copy and paste and DND

* GtkCellRendererAccel, a cell renderer for key combinations

* GtkCellRendererSpin, a cell renderer which edits numeric values 
  using a spin button

* GtkAction works with named icons in addition to stock icons

* GtkNotebook supports DND, allowing to reorder tabs, move tabs
  between notebooks and drop tabs on the desktop to open a new window

* GtkTreeView:
  - Enhanced customizability (e.g. grouping) with the
    show-expanders and level-indentation properties
  - Allow to embed the search popup
  - Better search popup positioning

* GtkFileChooser:
  - Communication with backends is now asynchronous to avoid
    blocking on file system operations. Due to the required interface
    changes, the GTK+ ABI version has been bumped to 2.10.0. Third-party
    file system backends have to be ported to the new interface, other
    modules, such as theme engines, input method modules or pixbuf loaders 
    have to be rebuilt so that they are installed in the right place
    for GTK+ to find them.
  - The location entry (popped up by C-L) has been integrated in the
    main dialog.
    
* Reworked hex Unicode input now requires Ctrl-Shift-U

* Animations can now be globally controlled by settings

* The gtk-touchscreen-mode setting controls a number of changes
  that make GTK+ work better on touchscreens

* Password entries can optionally show the last entered character
  for a short while, controlled by the password-hint-timeout setting

* GTK+ can now consult an additional fallback icon theme before
  falling back to hicolor

* Improved themability:
  - GTK+ supports symbolic colors, which can be set system-wide
    using a setting, and can be modified and used in rc files
    and theme engines
  - GTK+ sets window type hints on override-redirect windows to 
    help compositing managers apply proper bling
  - Paths in rc files can now refer to all subclasses of a class 
  - GtkRange steppers will appear insensitive when the slider
    is at the end; applications which need to handle this case
    (e.g. to extend the range) can opt out of this.
  - GtkRange::activate-slider style property allows themes
    to draw sliders differently while they are being dragged
  - GtkNotebook::tab-overlap and GtkNotebook::curvature style
    properties allow more flexible notebook theming
  - The spacing of buttons around children can be themed with
    the GtkButton::inner-border style property. Apps can override
    this per-widget using the corresponding inner-border property 
  - GtkMenu has acquired a horizontal-padding style property 
  - There are style properties for the color of hyperlinks,
    GtkWidget::link-color and GtkWidget::visited-link-color
  - GtkTreeview row hinting now takes the selection into account
  - Scrolling menus can be forced to always display both arrows,
    using the GtkMenu::double-arrows style property
  - Separators can be themed using the wide-separators, separator-width
    and separator-height style properties
  - GtkTreeView allows more flexible theming with the row-ending-details
    property
  - The pixbuf theme engines supports customized drawing of expanders
    and resize grips

* GDK changes:  
  - OS X backend
  - DirectFB backend 
  - Closing displays works
  - gdk_screen_is_composited to check for running compositing manager
  - Support for Super, Hyper and Meta modifiers

* gdk-pixbuf changes: 
  - Supports saving tiff 
  - Supports loading 16-bit pnm
  - Doesn't load entire gif animation to get first frame

* Bug fixes
  - Too many to list them here

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 1.3.1:

* GTK+ now uses the Pango library for text manipulation. All
  strings in GTK+ now are in Unicode, languages written
  from right-to-left, and complex-text languages are now supported.
* The gdk-pixbuf library for image loading and manipulation is 
  has been integrated with GTK+.
* The GTK+ object system has mostly been moved to GLib, separating
  it from the GUI code. Many significant enhancements have been
  made as part of this.
* A new text widget is now included. This started as a port
  of the Tk text widget, and includes such features of the Tk
  text widget as tags, marks, and unicode text support. It
  has been enhanced to support model-view operation and the
  full power of Pango.
* The GDK library has been extensively revised to support multiple
  windowing systems. The only fully functional backend in 1.3.1
  is the X11 backend, however, ports to Win32, Linux-framebuffer,
  Nano-X, BeOS, and MacOS exist in various states of completion,
  and at least some of these will be finished and integrated in 
  before the final GTK+-2.0 release.
* 32-bit coordinates are now supported throughout GDK and GTK+
  (they are emulated where not supported by the windowing system.)
* Many minor bug fixes and enhancements. Incompatible changes
  are documented in docs/Changes-2.0.txt

* Upgrade to libtool 1.3.4.

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 1.2.6:

* container queue_resize fixes
* gtk[vh]scale: minor fixups
* rename idle to idle_id in testgtk to avoid conflicts with 
  broken libs

  to old perl versions.
* fonts (and fontsets) are cached now.
* more autogeneration make rules and dependency fixups, we should be
  save with autogeneration up to make -j12 now ;)
* new window position GTK_WIN_POS_CENTER_ALWAYS, which will recenter the
  GtkWindow on every size change.
* major rework of window manager hints handling code, fixed a bunch of
  races with the new resizing code.
* the new wm hints and resizing code is absolutely perfect and bug free now,
  it only lacks testing ;)
* fixed up various rc style memory problems.
* gtk_widget_modify_style() now properly changes the style of realized widgets
  and references the style passed into it. if people worked around this bug,
  this will introduce a slight memory leak in their code.
  The code should typically look like:
            GtkRcStyle *rc_style = gtk_rc_style_new ();
            [...]
            gtk_widget_modify_style (widget, rc_style);
            gtk_rc_style_unref (rc_style);
* fix problems with positioning menus offscreen.
* GtkText fixes for some crashes and drawing errors.
* Better handling for unexpected window destroys in GDK and GTK+.
  This should make it possible to use a GtkPlug and catch the
  case where its parent socket is randomly killed.
* FAQ updates.
* FileSelection i18n patches, RadioButton fixups.
* many translation improvements.
* miscellaneous other bugs fixed.

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 1.2.4:

* DnD improvements (drags can be canceled with Esc now).
* suppressed configure event reordering in Gdk.
* rewrite of Gtk's configure event handling.
* major improvements for the object argument system (Elena Devdariani).
* major bugfixes for threading, GtkNotebook, GtkItemFactory, GtkCList and
  GtkCTree.
* tutorial/FAQ updates, new file generation.txt on autogenerated sources.
* configure's --with-glib= is "officially" unsupported.
* upgrade to libtool 1.3.3.
* various buglets fixed.

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 1.2.3:

* Upgrade to libtool 1.3
* Check for dgettext (for systems with old versions of GNU Gettext)
* Many bug fixes (see ChangeLog for details)

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 1.2.2:

* Improved Dnd behaviour with Motif applications.
* Bug fixes for the Gtk selection code.
* Minor bug fixes to the Gdk Atom cache and Dnd code (with --display option).
* Bug fixes and leak plugs for the Gdk IM code.
* Added gtk_object_get() facility to retrieve object arguments easily.
  The var args list expects ("arg-name", &value) pairs.
* Fixed mapping for GdkInputCondition<->GIOCondition, this should fix
  problems where closed pipes were no longer signaling GDK_INPUT_READ on
  systems with a native poll().
* Some cleanups to GtkLabel's memory allocation code (shouldn't leak memory
  anymore).
* We don't attempt to lookup xpm color "None" anymore, this should prevent
  eXodus (commercial X windows server) from popping up a color dialog every
  time a transparent pixmap is created.
* Fixed bug where Gtk timeout/idle handlers would execute without the global
  Gdk lock being held.
* Other minor bug fixes.

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 1.2.1:

* Many Bug fixes have been applied to the menu and accelerator code.
* GtkItemFactory can "adopt" foreign menu items now and manage their
  accelerator installation. This is often required to get GtkItemFactory
  like accelerator propagation between different windows with the same
  menu hierarchy and for centralized parsing and saving of accelerators.
* GtkCList/GtkCTree buttons should always display correctly now.
* Miscellaneous other bug fixes.

What's New in GTK+ 1.2.0 (since 1.0.x):

* New widgets: GtkFontSelector, GtkPacker, GtkItemFactory, GtkCTree,
  GtkInvisible, GtkCalendar, GtkLayout, GtkPlug, GtkSocket
* Many new features and robustness for existing widgets
* Theme support
* New DND implementation
* Internationalization of standard dialogs

* Tutorial improvements
* A bug fix or two

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 1.1.16:

* Major fixes and improvements for handlebox
* A change to the way widget->requisition works. Now,
  widget->requisition is always what the widget requested,
  unmodified by the usize. See Changes-1.2.txt for details.
  This correct various bugs with gtk_widget_set_usize().
* Fixes for XIM on X11R5 systems
* Don't allow cut-and-paste of text in password-style entries
* --enable-debug is now on by default for the development release.
  (When compiling for "production", use --enable-debug=minimum)
* Handle systems where Helvetica is not present more gracefully
* Fixes for memory leaks
* CList and CTree fixes
* Bug fixes for drawing problems. 
* Miscellaneous bug fixes to GtkLabel, GtkCList, GtkCTree,
  GtkColorsel, Focusing, DND
* Tutorial improvements

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 1.1.15:

* Tutorial Updates
* Added --libs gthread to gtk-config 
* Bug fixes

What is new in GTK+ 1.1.14:

* Additions to docs/Changes-1.2.txt
* Just warn when loading theme engine fails
* CLAMP GtkScale digits to a meaningful range
* GTK_LOCALDIR is now defined in a better fashion

    gtk_menu_set_title()
    gtk_toggle_button_get_active()
* Some locale fixups in gtkrc code
* Fixes to make gtk_radio_button_set_group() keep only
  one radio button in the group active
* Foreign windows are now always treated as viewable; this fixes
  a problem where updating didn't occur properly in GtkPlug
* DND fixes for 64 bit architectures, and for specifying operations 
  with modifier keys.
* Major revisions to GtkLayout: avoid having to create window
  for NO_WINDOW children, adjust allocations of children as 
  scrolled so queued draws work, and a resize is queued instead
  of allocating directly in a put() or move()

What is new in GTK+ 1.1.13:

* Dnd and selection bug fixes and memory purification.
* Widget sensitivity fixups.
* Tooltips windows are now named "gtk-tooltips" so rc file rules
  can match tooltips windows. Fixed interaction of tooltips and NO_WINDOW
  widgets.
* Spin buttons now update their values upon value retrieval.
* Overhaul of the resizing vs. redrawing logic to reduce redrawing needs
  a lot. Gtk makes full use of the draw_area coalescing code now, which
  got minorly improved as well.
* Containers map their Gdk windows after their children now to reduce
  expose event generation.
* Gdk event queue fixups, this solves the double-click problems people were
  recently having.
* Account for the fact that GSource's are only properly reentrant from
  within dispatch(), thus we don't do Gdk event processing from within
  check() or prepare() anymore.
* Rc files feature a bg_pixmap value of "<none>" now.
* Improved session management support in Gdk.  
* Automatic disabling of NLS if no gettext is found should work now.

  to a scrolled window don't get an automatic viewport anymore. a convenience
  function gtk_scrolled_window_add_with_viewport() is supplied for this task
* Deprecated functions will now issue a message, informing the programmer about
  the use of this function. These functions will get removed in future versions

    - toggle auto_resize for columns
* Must enhanced DND support, removed old DND code
* Idle functions are now implemented via GHook, giving a slight speed
  improvement
* An environment variable GTK_MODULES which takes a colon separated
  list of module names GTK+ will now automatically load at gtk_init() startup
* GtkFontSel now has support for an extra 'base' filter
* New function gdk_window_set_root_origin to get the real geometry taking

  --gtk-modules= command line switch. such modules have to export a
  G_MODULE_EXPORT void gtk_module_init (gint *argc, gchar ***argv);
  function which will be invoked to initialize the module. since such
  modules may create new widget types, they are always resident.
* The tutorial has been updated again.
* Changes to menus including tearoff menus and accelerators.
* Better support for modal dialogs.
* Removed CAN_FOCUS by default from scrollbars and button children of toolbar.
* More improvements and fixes for GtkCList and GtkCTree (i.e. row sorting).

* The GtkCTree API has undergone major renames (see ChangeLog entry from Lars
  Hamann on Tue Aug 18 00:29:13 1998).
* A bunch of varargs functions changed to get va_lists working on systems that
  implement va_lists as arrays.

* Far better support for object arguments, revamp of the underlying
  mechanism for speed and reusability. Child/object arguments don't
  need to be preceded by the "GtkType::" portion anymore.
* Removed GtkAcceleratorTable in favour of GtkAccelGroup, accelerator display
  is now performed by a new widget GtkAccelLabel.
* Overhaul of the resizing code. Resizing behaviour can now be specified
  on GtkContainer basis, so the underlying algorithm isn't only available
  for GtkWindows.
* GtkTables are now fully resizable.
* The GtkType system now supports an additional base class initialization
  function.
* GtkStyles and key bindings can now be looked up depending on the base
  types of a widget, through a new keyword `class' in rc files.
