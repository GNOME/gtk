Overview of Changes in 4.16.0, 06-09-2024
=========================================

Note: This release changes the default GSK renderer to be Vulkan,
on Wayland. Other platforms still use ngl. The intent of this change
is to use the best available platform APIs. You can still override
the renderer choice using the GSK_RENDERER environment variable.

We believe that most of the problems reported with the new renderers
during the 4.13 and 4.15 development cycles have been addressed by now.

But the new renderers and dmabuf support are using graphics drivers
in different ways than the old gl renderer, and trigger new driver bugs.
Therefore, it is recommended to use the latest mesa release (24.2)
with the new renderers.

Overview of Changes in 4.13.6, 25-01-2024
=========================================

This release changes the ngl renderer to be the default renderer.

The intent of this change is to get wider testing and verify that
the new renderers are production-ready. If significant problems
show up, we will revert this change for 4.14.

You can still override the renderer choice using the GSK_RENDERER
environment variable.

Since ngl can handle fractional scaling much better than the old gl
renderer, we allow fractional scaling by default with gl now. If you
are using the old gl renderer (e.g. because your system is limited to
GLES2), you can disable fractional scaling by setting the GDK_DEBUG
environment variable to include the gl-no-fractional key.

* GtkColumnView:
 - Fix infinite loops in dispose
 - Fix problems with weak ref cycles in GtkExpression

* GtkListView:
 - Fix some corner cases with sections during insertions and deletions
 - Don't double-recycle widgets

* GtkStack:
 - Add automatic cleanup for GtkStackPage

 - Use standard cursor names for drag cursors
 - Enable fractional scaling with gl by default

* GSK:
 - Many fixes and improvements to the unified renderers:
   - Fix text rendering with the uber shader
   - Fix rounding issues with fractional scales
   - Fix some memory leaks
   - Many text rendering fixes
   - Implement subpixel positioning for glyphs
   - Support custom fonts in node files
   - Add tests for font rendering
   - Fix drawing of repeat nodes
   - Implement subpixels positioning
   - Evict stale textures, glyphs and atlases from the cache

   - Avoid a crash in the mask demo
   - Respect opacity of the first child node in containers
 - Some fixes and improvements to the fallback renderer:
   - Fix drawing of repeat nodes
 - Make ngl the default renderer

* Wayland:
 - Fix problems with tablet cursors
 - Fix problems without seats

* Accessibility:
 - Respect a separate "show-status-shapes setting
 - Fix change notification for accessible names on some widgets

* Inspector:
 - Show the git commit in devel builds

Overview of Changes in 4.13.5, 07-01-2024
=========================================

This release adds two new GSK renderers called vulkan and ngl,
that are built from the same sources. The new renderers can
handle many corner cases correctly that the current gl renderer
does not handle, and they offer advantages such as antialiasing
and supersampled gradients.

The new renderers are still considered experimental, and GTK
will only use them if they are explicitly selected using the
GSK_RENDERER environment variable.

As part of this work, the GSK include files have been rearranged.
It is no longer necessary to include renderer-specific headers for
ngl and vulkan (and doing so will trigger deprecation warnings),
and their constructors are always available.

The previously available experimental GdkVulkanContext APIs and
the old Vulkan renderer have been removed.

Vulkan is now enabled by default, and Linux distributions should
build GTK with Vulkan support. This requires the glslc shader
compiler as a new dependency.

Vulkan is now also used for dmabuf support.

* GtkDropdown:
 - Fix display of initial selection

* GtkShortcutsWindow:
 - Make the window adapt to smaller screen widths

* GtkTextView:
 - Fix a possible NULL dereference in history

* GDK:
 - Make the png loader safer against overflows

 - Fix some errors in handling of texture formats and mipmaps


Overview of Changes in 4.13.4, 30-12-2023
=========================================

 - Return an error if no file is selected

* GtkFileLauncher:
 - Add a writable property

* GtkFileChooserNative:
 - Make closing portal file dialogs work

* GtkEmojiChooser:
 - Update Emoji data to CLDR v43

* GtkStringList:
 - Add item-type and n-itmes properties

* Input:
 - Respect GTK grabs on DND events
 - Fix crossing event generation for enter/leave

* Wayland:
 - Avoid recreating wl_buffers needlessly
 - Be more careful when loading cursors

* Dmabuf:

   textures, as long as they are raised. Decline to offload
   with fractional scales.

* Accessibility:
 - Add a few more accessible roles

* GL:
