 * @Short_description: Interface for widgets that can be used for editing cells
 * @Title: GtkCellEditable
 * @See_also: #GtkCellRenderer
 *
 * The #GtkCellEditable interface must be implemented for widgets to be usable
 * to edit the contents of a #GtkTreeView cell. It provides a way to specify how
 * temporary widgets should be configured for editing, get the new value, etc.
