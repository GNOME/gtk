 * SECTION:gtkdroptargetasync
 * @Short_description: Event controller to receive DND drops
 * @Title: GtkDropTargetAsync
 * @See_also: #GtkDropTarget
 *
 * GtkDropTargetAsync is an auxiliary object that can be used to receive
 * Drag-and-Drop operations.  
 * It is the more complete but also more complex method of handling drop
 * operations compared to #GtkDropTarget and you should only use it if
 * #GtkDropTarget doesn't provide all the features you need.
 *
 * To use a #GtkDropTargetAsync to receive drops on a widget, you create
 * a #GtkDropTargetAsync object, configure which data formats and actions
 * you support, connect to its signals, and then attach
 * it to the widget with gtk_widget_add_controller().
 *
 * During a drag operation, the first signal that a GtkDropTargetAsync
 * emits is #GtkDropTargetAsync::accept, which is meant to determine
 * whether the target is a possible drop site for the ongoing drop.
 * The default handler for the ::accept signal accepts the drop
 * if it finds a compatible data format and an action that is supported
 * on both sides.
 *
 * If it is, and the widget becomes a target, you will receive a
 * #GtkDropTargetAsync::drag-enter signal, followed by
 * #GtkDropTargetAsync::drag-motion signals as the pointer moves,
 * optionally a #GtkDropTargetAsync::drop signal when a drop happens,
 * and finally a #GtkDropTargetAsync::drag-leave signal when the pointer
 * moves off the widget.
 *
 * The ::drag-enter and ::drag-motion handler return a #GdkDragAction
 * to update the status of the ongoing operation. The ::drop handler
 * should decide if it ultimately accepts the drop and if it does, it
 * should initiate the data transfer and finish the operation by calling
 * gdk_drop_finish().
 *
 * Between the ::drag-enter and ::drag-leave signals the widget is a
 * current drop target, and will receive the %GTK_STATE_FLAG_DROP_ACTIVE
 * state, which can be used by themes to style the widget as a drop target.

   * The ::drop signal is emitted on the drop site when the user drops
   * the data onto the widget. The signal handler must determine whether
   * the pointer position is in a drop zone or not. If it is not in a drop
   * zone, it returns %FALSE and no further processing is necessary.
   *
   * Otherwise, the handler returns %TRUE. In this case, this handler will
   * accept the drop. The handler must ensure that gdk_drop_finish() is
   * called to let the source know that the drop is done. The call to
   * gtk_drag_finish() must only be done when all data has been received.
   *
   * To receive the data, use one of the read functions provides by #GdkDrop
   * such as gdk_drop_read_async() or gdk_drop_read_value_async().
   *
   * Returns: whether the drop is accepted at the given pointer position
