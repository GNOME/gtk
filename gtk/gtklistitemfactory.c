/**
 * SECTION:gtklistitemfactory
 * @Title: GtkListItemFactory
 * @Short_description: Mapping list items to widgets
 *
 * #GtkListItemFactory is one of the core concepts of handling list widgets.
 * It is the object tasked with creating widgets for items taken from a
 * #GListModel when the views need them and updating them as the items
 * displayed by the view change.
 *
 * A view is usually only able to display anything after both a factory
 * and a model have been set on the view. So it is important that you do
 * not skip this step when setting up your first view.
 *
 * Because views do not display the whole list at once but only a few
 * items, they only need to maintain a few widgets at a time. They will
 * instruct the #GtkListItemFactory to create these widgets and bind them
 * to the items that are currently displayed.  
 * As the list model changes or the user scrolls to the list, the items will
 * change and the view will instruct the factory to bind the widgets to those
 * new items.
 *
 * The actual widgets used for displaying those widgets is provided by you.
 *
 * When the factory needs widgets created, it will create a #GtkListItem and
 * hand it to your code to set up a widget for. This list item will provide
 * various properties with information about what item to display and provide
 * you with some opportunities to configure its behavior. See the #GtkListItem
 * documentation for further details.
 *
 * Various implementations of #GtkListItemFactory exist to allow you different
 * ways to provide those widgets. The most common implementations are
 * #GtkBuilderListItemFactory which takes a #GtkBuilder .ui file and then creates
 * and manages widgets everything automatically from the information in that file
 * and #GtkSignalListItemFactory which allows you to connect to signals with your
 * own code and retain full control over how the widgets are setup and managed.
 *
 * A #GtkListItemFactory is supposed to be final - that means its behavior should
 * not change and the first widget created from it should behave the same way as
 * the last widget created from it.  
 * If you intend to do changes to the behavior, it is recommended that you create
 * a new #GtkListItemFactory which will allow the views to recreate its widgets.
 *
 * Once you have chosen your factory and created it, you need to set it on the
 * view widget you want to use it with, such as via gtk_list_view_set_factory().
 * Reusing factories across different views is allowed, but very uncommon.
