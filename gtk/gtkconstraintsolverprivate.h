/* Symbolic weight thresholds
 *
 * Constraint weights live on a continuum, but we use thresholds for simplicity's
 * sake, so we don't have to necessarily reason in terms of numeric values.
 *
 * The public API has a similar approach, where the symbolic constants are negative
 * values, and positive values are explicit weights. We map those values into
 * numeric values that the GtkConstraintSolver can plug into the linear equations
 * tableau.
