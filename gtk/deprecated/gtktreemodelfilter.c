/**
 * GtkTreeModelFilter:
 *
 * A `GtkTreeModel` which hides parts of an underlying tree model
 *
 * A `GtkTreeModelFilter` is a tree model which wraps another tree model,
 * and can do the following things:
 *
 * - Filter specific rows, based on data from a “visible column”, a column
 *   storing booleans indicating whether the row should be filtered or not,
 *   or based on the return value of a “visible function”, which gets a
 *   model, iter and user_data and returns a boolean indicating whether the
 *   row should be filtered or not.
 *
 * - Modify the “appearance” of the model, using a modify function.
 *   This is extremely powerful and allows for just changing some
 *   values and also for creating a completely different model based
 *   on the given child model.
 *
 * - Set a different root node, also known as a “virtual root”. You can pass
 *   in a `GtkTreePath` indicating the root node for the filter at construction
 *   time.
 *
 * The basic API is similar to `GtkTreeModelSort`. For an example on its usage,
 * see the section on `GtkTreeModelSort`.
 *
 * When using `GtkTreeModelFilter`, it is important to realize that
 * `GtkTreeModelFilter` maintains an internal cache of all nodes which are
 * visible in its clients. The cache is likely to be a subtree of the tree
 * exposed by the child model. `GtkTreeModelFilter` will not cache the entire
 * child model when unnecessary to not compromise the caching mechanism
 * that is exposed by the reference counting scheme. If the child model
 * implements reference counting, unnecessary signals may not be emitted
 * because of reference counting rule 3, see the `GtkTreeModel`
 * documentation. (Note that e.g. `GtkTreeStore` does not implement
 * reference counting and will always emit all signals, even when
 * the receiving node is not visible).
 *
 * Because of this, limitations for possible visible functions do apply.
 * In general, visible functions should only use data or properties from
 * the node for which the visibility state must be determined, its siblings
 * or its parents. Usually, having a dependency on the state of any child
 * node is not possible, unless references are taken on these explicitly.
 * When no such reference exists, no signals may be received for these child
 * nodes (see reference counting rule number 3 in the `GtkTreeModel` section).
 *
 * Determining the visibility state of a given node based on the state
 * of its child nodes is a frequently occurring use case. Therefore,
 * `GtkTreeModelFilter` explicitly supports this. For example, when a node
 * does not have any children, you might not want the node to be visible.
 * As soon as the first row is added to the node’s child level (or the
 * last row removed), the node’s visibility should be updated.
 *
 * This introduces a dependency from the node on its child nodes. In order
 * to accommodate this, `GtkTreeModelFilter` must make sure the necessary
 * signals are received from the child model. This is achieved by building,
 * for all nodes which are exposed as visible nodes to `GtkTreeModelFilter`'s
 * clients, the child level (if any) and take a reference on the first node
 * in this level. Furthermore, for every row-inserted, row-changed or
 * row-deleted signal (also these which were not handled because the node
 * was not cached), `GtkTreeModelFilter` will check if the visibility state
 * of any parent node has changed.
 *
 * Beware, however, that this explicit support is limited to these two
 * cases. For example, if you want a node to be visible only if two nodes
 * in a child’s child level (2 levels deeper) are visible, you are on your
 * own. In this case, either rely on `GtkTreeStore` to emit all signals
 * because it does not implement reference counting, or for models that
 * do implement reference counting, obtain references on these child levels
 * yourself.
 *
 * Deprecated: 4.10: Use [class@Gtk.FilterListModel] instead.

/* Notes on this implementation of GtkTreeModelFilter
 * ==================================================
 *
 * Warnings
 * --------
 *
 * In this code there is a potential for confusion as to whether an iter,
 * path or value refers to the GtkTreeModelFilter model, or to the child
 * model that has been set. As a convention, variables referencing the
 * child model will have a c_ prefix before them (ie. c_iter, c_value,
 * c_path). In case the c_ prefixed names are already in use, an f_
 * prefix is used. Conversion of iterators and paths between
 * GtkTreeModelFilter and the child model is done through the various
 * gtk_tree_model_filter_convert_* functions.
 *
 * Even though the GtkTreeModelSort and GtkTreeModelFilter have very
 * similar data structures, many assumptions made in the GtkTreeModelSort
 * code do *not* apply in the GtkTreeModelFilter case. Reference counting
 * in particular is more complicated in GtkTreeModelFilter, because
 * we explicitly support reliance on the state of a node’s children as
 * outlined in the public API documentation. Because of these differences,
 * you are strongly recommended to first read through these notes before
 * making any modification to the code.
 *
 * Iterator format
 * ---------------
 *
 * The iterator format of iterators handed out by GtkTreeModelFilter is
 * as follows:
 *
 *     iter->stamp = filter->priv->stamp
 *     iter->user_data = FilterLevel
 *     iter->user_data2 = FilterElt
 *
 * Internal data structure
 * -----------------------
 *
 * Using FilterLevel and FilterElt, GtkTreeModelFilter maintains a “cache”
 * of the mapping from GtkTreeModelFilter nodes to nodes in the child model.
 * This is to avoid re-creating a level each time (which involves computing
 * visibility for each node in that level) an operation is requested on
 * GtkTreeModelFilter, such as get iter, get path and get value.
 *
 * A FilterElt corresponds to a single node. The FilterElt can either be
 * visible or invisible in the model that is exposed to the clients of this
 * GtkTreeModelFilter. The visibility state is stored in the “visible_siter”
 * field, which is NULL when the node is not visible. The FilterLevel keeps
 * a reference to the parent FilterElt and its FilterLevel (if any). The
 * FilterElt can have a “children” pointer set, which points at a child
 * level (a sub level).
 *
 * In a FilterLevel, two separate GSequences are maintained. One contains
 * all nodes of this FilterLevel, regardless of the visibility state of
 * the node. Another contains only visible nodes. A visible FilterElt
 * is thus present in both the full and the visible GSequence. The
 * GSequence allows for fast access, addition and removal of nodes.
 *
 * It is important to recognize the two different mappings that play
 * a part in this code:
 *   I.  The mapping from the client to this model. The order in which
 *       nodes are stored in the *visible* GSequence is the order in
 *       which the nodes are exposed to clients of the GtkTreeModelFilter.
 *   II. The mapping from this model to its child model. Each FilterElt
 *       contains an “offset” field which is the offset of the
 *       corresponding node in the child model.
 *
 * Throughout the code, two kinds of paths relative to the GtkTreeModelFilter
 * (those generated from the sequence positions) are used. There are paths
 * which take non-visible nodes into account (generated from the full
 * sequences) and paths which don’t (generated from the visible sequences).
 * Paths which have been generated from the full sequences should only be
 * used internally and NEVER be passed along with a signal emisson.
 *
 * Reference counting
 * ------------------
 *
 * GtkTreeModelFilter forwards all reference and unreference operations
 * to the corresponding node in the child model. In addition,
 * GtkTreeModelFilter will also add references of its own. The full reference
 * count of each node (i.e. all forwarded references and these by the
 * filter model) is maintained internally in the “ref_count” fields in
 * FilterElt and FilterLevel. Because there is a need to determine whether
 * a node should be visible for the client, the reference count of only
 * the forwarded references is maintained as well, in the “ext_ref_count”
 * fields.
 *
 * In a few cases, GtkTreeModelFilter takes additional references on
 * nodes. The first case is that a reference is taken on the parent
 * (if any) of each level. This happens in gtk_tree_model_filter_build_level()
 * and the reference is released again in gtk_tree_model_filter_free_level().
 * This ensures that for all references which are taken by the filter
 * model, all parent nodes are referenced according to reference counting
 * rule 1 in the GtkTreeModel documentation.
 *
 * A second case is required to support visible functions which depend on
 * the state of a node’s children (see the public API documentation for
 * GtkTreeModelFilter above). We build the child level of each node that
 * could be visible in the client (i.e. the level has an ext_ref_count > 0;
 * not the elt, because the elt might be invisible and thus unreferenced
 * by the client). For each node that becomes visible, due to insertion or
 * changes in visibility state, it is checked whether node has children, if
 * so the child level is built.
 *
 * A reference is taken on the first node of each level so that the child
 * model will emit all signals for this level, due to reference counting
 * rule 3 in the GtkTreeModel documentation. If due to changes in the level,
 * another node becomes the first node (e.g. due to insertion or reordering),
 * this reference is transferred from the old to the new first node.
 *
 * When a level has an *external* reference count of zero (which means that
 * none of the nodes in the level is referenced by the clients), the level
 * has a “zero ref count” on all its parents. As soon as the level reaches
 * an *external* reference count of zero, the zero ref count value is
 * incremented by one for all parents of this level. Due to the additional
 * references taken by the filter model, it is important to base the
 * zero ref count on the external reference count instead of on the full
 * reference count of the node.
 *
 * The zero ref count value aids in determining which portions of the
 * cache are possibly unused and could be removed. If a FilterElt has
 * a zero ref count of one, then its child level is unused. However, the
 * child level can only be removed from the cache if the FilterElt's
 * parent level has an external ref count of zero. (Not the parent elt,
 * because an invisible parent elt with external ref count == 0 might still
 * become visible because of a state change in its child level!).  Otherwise,
 * monitoring this level is necessary to possibly update the visibility state
 * of the parent. This is an important difference from GtkTreeModelSort!
 *
 * Signals are only required for levels with an external ref count > 0.
 * This due to reference counting rule 3, see the GtkTreeModel
 * documentation. In the GtkTreeModelFilter we try hard to stick to this
 * rule and not emit redundant signals (though redundant emissions of
 * row-has-child-toggled could appear frequently; it does happen that
 * we simply forward the signal emitted by e.g. GtkTreeStore but also
 * emit our own copy).
