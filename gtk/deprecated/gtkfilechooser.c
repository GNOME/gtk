/**
 * GtkFileChooser:
 *
 * `GtkFileChooser` is an interface that can be implemented by file
 * selection widgets.
 *
 * In GTK, the main objects that implement this interface are
 * [class@Gtk.FileChooserWidget] and [class@Gtk.FileChooserDialog].
 *
 * You do not need to write an object that implements the `GtkFileChooser`
 * interface unless you are trying to adapt an existing file selector to
 * expose a standard programming interface.
 *
 * `GtkFileChooser` allows for shortcuts to various places in the filesystem.
 * In the default implementation these are displayed in the left pane. It
 * may be a bit confusing at first that these shortcuts come from various
 * sources and in various flavours, so lets explain the terminology here:
 *
 * - Bookmarks: are created by the user, by dragging folders from the
 *   right pane to the left pane, or by using the “Add”. Bookmarks
 *   can be renamed and deleted by the user.
 *
 * - Shortcuts: can be provided by the application. For example, a Paint
 *   program may want to add a shortcut for a Clipart folder. Shortcuts
 *   cannot be modified by the user.
 *
 * - Volumes: are provided by the underlying filesystem abstraction. They are
 *   the “roots” of the filesystem.
 *
 * # File Names and Encodings
 *
 * When the user is finished selecting files in a `GtkFileChooser`, your
 * program can get the selected filenames as `GFile`s.
 *
 * # Adding options
 *
 * You can add extra widgets to a file chooser to provide options
 * that are not present in the default design, by using
 * [method@Gtk.FileChooser.add_choice]. Each choice has an identifier and
 * a user visible label; additionally, each choice can have multiple
 * options. If a choice has no option, it will be rendered as a
 * check button with the given label; if a choice has options, it will
 * be rendered as a combo box.
 *
 * Deprecated: 4.10: Use [class@Gtk.FileDialog] instead
