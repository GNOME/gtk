/**
 * GtkAppChooser:
 *
 * `GtkAppChooser` is an interface for widgets which allow the user to
 * choose an application.
 *
 * The main objects that implement this interface are
 * [class@Gtk.AppChooserWidget],
 * [class@Gtk.AppChooserDialog] and [class@Gtk.AppChooserButton].
 *
 * Applications are represented by GIO `GAppInfo` objects here.
 * GIO has a concept of recommended and fallback applications for a
 * given content type. Recommended applications are those that claim
 * to handle the content type itself, while fallback also includes
 * applications that handle a more generic content type. GIO also
 * knows the default and last-used application for a given content
 * type. The `GtkAppChooserWidget` provides detailed control over
 * whether the shown list of applications should include default,
 * recommended or fallback applications.
 *
 * To obtain the application that has been selected in a `GtkAppChooser`,
 * use [method@Gtk.AppChooser.get_app_info].
 *
 * Deprecated: 4.10: The application selection widgets should be
 *   implemented according to the design of each platform and/or
 *   application requiring them.
