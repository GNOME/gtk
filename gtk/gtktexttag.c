/**
 * GtkTextTag:
 *
 * A tag that can be applied to text contained in a `GtkTextBuffer`.
 *
 * You may wish to begin by reading the
 * [text widget conceptual overview](section-text-widget.html),
 * which gives an overview of all the objects and data types
 * related to the text widget and how they work together.
 *
 * Tags should be in the [class@Gtk.TextTagTable] for a given
 * `GtkTextBuffer` before using them with that buffer.
 *
 * [method@Gtk.TextBuffer.create_tag] is the best way to create tags.
 * See “gtk4-demo” for numerous examples.
 *
 * For each property of `GtkTextTag`, there is a “set” property, e.g.
 * “font-set” corresponds to “font”. These “set” properties reflect
 * whether a property has been set or not.
 *
 * They are maintained by GTK and you should not set them independently.
