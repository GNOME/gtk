/*
 * All our curves are second degree linear differential equations, and
 * so they can always be written as linear combinations of 2 base
 * solutions. c1 and c2 are the coefficients to these two base solutions,
 * and are computed from the initial position and velocity.
 *
 * In the case of simple deceleration, the differential equation is
 *
 *   y'' = -my'
 *
 * With m the resistence factor. For this we use the following 2
 * base solutions:
 *
 *   f1(x) = 1
 *   f2(x) = exp(-mx)
 *
 * In the case of overshoot, the differential equation is
 *
 *   y'' = -my' - ky
 *
 * With m the resistance, and k the spring stiffness constant. We let
 * k = m^2 / 4, so that the system is critically damped (ie, returns to its
 * equilibrium position as quickly as possible, without oscillating), and offset
 * the whole thing, such that the equilibrium position is at 0. This gives the
 * base solutions
 *
 *   f1(x) = exp(-mx / 2)
 *   f2(x) = t exp(-mx / 2)
