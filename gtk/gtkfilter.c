/**
 * GtkFilter:
 *
 * Describes the filtering to be performed by a [class@Gtk.FilterListModel].
 *
 * The model will use the filter to determine if it should include items
 * or not by calling [method@Gtk.Filter.match] for each item and only
 * keeping the ones that the function returns true for.
 *
 * Filters may change what items they match through their lifetime. In that
 * case, they will emit the [signal@Gtk.Filter::changed] signal to notify
 * that previous filter results are no longer valid and that items should
 * be checked again via [method@Gtk.Filter.match].
 *
 * GTK provides various pre-made filter implementations for common filtering
 * operations. These filters often include properties that can be linked to
 * various widgets to easily allow searches.
 *
 * However, in particular for large lists or complex search methods, it is
 * also possible to subclass `GtkFilter` and provide one's own filter.
