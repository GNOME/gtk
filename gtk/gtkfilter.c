/**
 * SECTION:gtkfilter
 * @Short_description: Filtering items in GTK
 * @Title: GtkFilter
 * @See_also: #GtkFilerListModel
 *
 * #GtkFilter is the way to describe filters to be used in #GtkFilterListModel.
 * 
 * The model will use a filter to determine if it should filter items or not
 * by calling gtk_filter_filter() for each item and only keeping the ones
 * visible that the function returns %TRUE for.
 *
 * Filters may change what items they match through their lifetime. In that
 * case they can call gtk_filter_changed() which will emit the GtkFilter:changed
 * signal to notify that previous filter results are no longer valid and that
 * items should be checked via gtk_filter_filter() again.
 *
 * GTK provides various premade filter implementations for common filtering
 * operations. These filters often include properties that can be linked to
 * various widgets to easily allow searches.  
 *
 * However, in particular for large lists or complex search methods, it is
 * also possible to subclass #GtkFilter and provide one's own filter.
