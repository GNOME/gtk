/**
 * GtkActionable:
 *
 * The `GtkActionable` interface provides a convenient way of associating
 * widgets with actions.
 *
 * It primarily consists of two properties: [property@Gtk.Actionable:action-name]
 * and [property@Gtk.Actionable:action-target]. There are also some convenience
 * APIs for setting these properties.
 *
 * The action will be looked up in action groups that are found among
 * the widgets ancestors. Most commonly, these will be the actions with
 * the “win.” or “app.” prefix that are associated with the
 * `GtkApplicationWindow` or `GtkApplication`, but other action groups that
 * are added with [method@Gtk.Widget.insert_action_group] will be consulted
 * as well.

 * The target value has two purposes. First, it is used as the parameter
 * to activation of the action associated with the `GtkActionable` widget.
 * Second, it is used to determine if the widget should be rendered as
 * “active” — the widget is active if the state is equal to the given target.
 *
 * Consider the example of associating a set of buttons with a [iface@Gio.Action]
 * with string state in a typical “radio button” situation. Each button
 * will be associated with the same action, but with a different target
 * value for that action. Clicking on a particular button will activate
 * the action with the target of that button, which will typically cause
 * the action’s state to change to that value. Since the action’s state
 * is now equal to the target value of the button, the button will now
 * be rendered as active (and the other buttons, with different targets,
 * rendered inactive).
