/**
 * SECTION:gtkapplication
 * @title: GtkApplication
 * @short_description: Application class
 *
 * #GtkApplication is a class that handles many important aspects
 * of a GTK+ application in a convenient fashion, without enforcing
 * a one-size-fits-all application model.
 *
 * Currently, GtkApplication handles GTK initialization, application
 * uniqueness, session management, provides some basic scriptability and
 * desktop shell integration by exporting actions and menus and manages a
 * list of toplevel windows whose life-cycle is automatically tied to the
 * life-cycle of your application.
 *
 * While GtkApplication works fine with plain #GtkWindows, it is recommended
 * to use it together with #GtkApplicationWindow.
 *
 * When GDK threads are enabled, GtkApplication will acquire the GDK
 * lock when invoking actions that arrive from other processes.  The GDK
 * lock is not touched for local action invocations.  In order to have
 * actions invoked in a predictable context it is therefore recommended
 * that the GDK lock be held while invoking actions locally with
 * g_action_group_activate_action().  The same applies to actions
 * associated with #GtkApplicationWindow and to the “activate” and
 * “open” #GApplication methods.
 *
 * ## Automatic resources ## {#automatic-resources}
 *
 * #GtkApplication will automatically load menus from the #GtkBuilder
 * resource located at "gtk/menus.ui", relative to the application's
 * resource base path (see g_application_set_resource_base_path()).  The
 * menu with the ID "app-menu" is taken as the application's app menu
 * and the menu with the ID "menubar" is taken as the application's
 * menubar.  Additional menus (most interesting submenus) can be named
 * and accessed via gtk_application_get_menu_by_id() which allows for
 * dynamic population of a part of the menu structure.
 *
 * If the resources "gtk/menus-appmenu.ui" or "gtk/menus-traditional.ui" are
 * present then these files will be used in preference, depending on the value
 * of gtk_application_prefers_app_menu(). If the resource "gtk/menus-common.ui"
 * is present it will be loaded as well. This is useful for storing items that
 * are referenced from both "gtk/menus-appmenu.ui" and
 * "gtk/menus-traditional.ui".
 *
 * It is also possible to provide the menus manually using
 * gtk_application_set_app_menu() and gtk_application_set_menubar().
 *
 * #GtkApplication will also automatically setup an icon search path for
 * the default icon theme by appending "icons" to the resource base
 * path.  This allows your application to easily store its icons as
 * resources.  See gtk_icon_theme_add_resource_path() for more
 * information.
 *
 * If there is a resource located at "gtk/help-overlay.ui" which
 * defines a #GtkShortcutsWindow with ID "help_overlay" then GtkApplication
 * associates an instance of this shortcuts window with each
 * #GtkApplicationWindow and sets up keyboard accelerators (Control-F1
 * and Control-?) to open it. To create a menu item that displays the
 * shortcuts window, associate the item with the action win.show-help-overlay.
 *
 * ## A simple application ## {#gtkapplication}
 *
 * [A simple example](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/tree/master/examples/bp/bloatpad.c)
 *
 * GtkApplication optionally registers with a session manager
 * of the users session (if you set the #GtkApplication:register-session
 * property) and offers various functionality related to the session
 * life-cycle.
 *
 * An application can block various ways to end the session with
 * the gtk_application_inhibit() function. Typical use cases for
 * this kind of inhibiting are long-running, uninterruptible operations,
 * such as burning a CD or performing a disk backup. The session
 * manager may not honor the inhibitor, but it can be expected to
 * inform the user about the negative consequences of ending the
 * session while inhibitors are present.
 *

 * @flags: what types of actions should be inhibited
 * @reason: (allow-none): a short, human-readable string that explains
 *     why these operations are inhibited
 *
 * Inform the session manager that certain types of actions should be
 * inhibited. This is not guaranteed to work on all platforms and for
 * all types of actions.
 *
 * Applications should invoke this method when they begin an operation
 * that should not be interrupted, such as creating a CD or DVD. The
 * types of actions that may be blocked are specified by the @flags
 * parameter. When the application completes the operation it should
 * call gtk_application_uninhibit() to remove the inhibitor. Note that
 * an application can have multiple inhibitors, and all of them must
 * be individually removed. Inhibitors are also cleared when the
 * application exits.
 *
 * Applications should not expect that they will always be able to block
 * the action. In most cases, users will be given the option to force
 * the action to take place.
 *
 * Reasons should be short and to the point.
 *
 * If @window is given, the session manager may point the user to
 * this window to find out more about why the action is inhibited.
 *
 * Returns: A non-zero cookie that is used to uniquely identify this
 *     request. It should be used as an argument to gtk_application_uninhibit()
 *     in order to remove the request. If the platform does not support
 *     inhibiting or the request failed for some reason, 0 is returned.
