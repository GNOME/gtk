/*< private >
 * SECTION:gtkactionobserver
 * @short_description: an interface implemented by objects that are
 *                     interested in monitoring actions for changes
 *
 * GtkActionObserver is a simple interface allowing objects that wish to
 * be notified of changes to actions to be notified of those changes.
 *
 * It is also possible to monitor changes to action groups using
 * #GObject signals, but there are a number of reasons that this
 * approach could become problematic:
 *
 *  - there are four separate signals that must be manually connected
 *    and disconnected
 *
 *  - when a large number of different observers wish to monitor a
 *    (usually disjoint) set of actions within the same action group,
 *    there is only one way to avoid having all notifications delivered
 *    to all observers: signal detail.  In order to use signal detail,
 *    each action name must be quarked, which is not always practical.
 *
 *  - even if quarking is acceptable, #GObject signal details are
 *    implemented by scanning a linked list, so there is no real
 *    decrease in complexity
