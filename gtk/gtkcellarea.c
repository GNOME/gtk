 * SECTION:gtkcellarea
 * @Short_Description: An abstract class for laying out GtkCellRenderers
 * @Title: GtkCellArea
 *
 * The #GtkCellArea is an abstract class for #GtkCellLayout widgets
 * (also referred to as "layouting widgets") to interface with an
 * arbitrary number of #GtkCellRenderers and interact with the user
 * for a given #GtkTreeModel row.
 *
 * The cell area handles events, focus navigation, drawing and
 * size requests and allocations for a given row of data.
 *
 * Usually users dont have to interact with the #GtkCellArea directly
 * unless they are implementing a cell-layouting widget themselves.
 *
 * # Requesting area sizes
 *
 * As outlined in
 * [GtkWidget’s geometry management section][geometry-management],
 * GTK+ uses a height-for-width
 * geometry management system to compute the sizes of widgets and user
 * interfaces. #GtkCellArea uses the same semantics to calculate the
 * size of an area for an arbitrary number of #GtkTreeModel rows.
 *
 * When requesting the size of a cell area one needs to calculate
 * the size for a handful of rows, and this will be done differently by
 * different layouting widgets. For instance a #GtkTreeViewColumn
 * always lines up the areas from top to bottom while a #GtkIconView
 * on the other hand might enforce that all areas received the same
 * width and wrap the areas around, requesting height for more cell
 * areas when allocated less width.
 *
 * It’s also important for areas to maintain some cell
 * alignments with areas rendered for adjacent rows (cells can
 * appear “columnized” inside an area even when the size of
 * cells are different in each row). For this reason the #GtkCellArea
 * uses a #GtkCellAreaContext object to store the alignments
 * and sizes along the way (as well as the overall largest minimum
 * and natural size for all the rows which have been calculated
 * with the said context).
 *
 * The #GtkCellAreaContext is an opaque object specific to the
 * #GtkCellArea which created it (see gtk_cell_area_create_context()).
 * The owning cell-layouting widget can create as many contexts as
 * it wishes to calculate sizes of rows which should receive the
 * same size in at least one orientation (horizontally or vertically),
 * However, it’s important that the same #GtkCellAreaContext which
 * was used to request the sizes for a given #GtkTreeModel row be
 * used when rendering or processing events for that row.
 *
 * In order to request the width of all the rows at the root level
 * of a #GtkTreeModel one would do the following:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * GtkTreeIter iter;
 * gint        minimum_width;
 * gint        natural_width;
 *
 * valid = gtk_tree_model_get_iter_first (model, &iter);
 * while (valid)
 *   {
 *     gtk_cell_area_apply_attributes (area, model, &iter, FALSE, FALSE);
 *     gtk_cell_area_get_preferred_width (area, context, widget, NULL, NULL);
 *
 *     valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (model, &iter);
 *   }
 * gtk_cell_area_context_get_preferred_width (context, &minimum_width, &natural_width);
 * ]|
 *
 * Note that in this example it’s not important to observe the
 * returned minimum and natural width of the area for each row
 * unless the cell-layouting object is actually interested in the
 * widths of individual rows. The overall width is however stored
 * in the accompanying #GtkCellAreaContext object and can be consulted
 * at any time.
 *
 * This can be useful since #GtkCellLayout widgets usually have to
 * support requesting and rendering rows in treemodels with an
 * exceedingly large amount of rows. The #GtkCellLayout widget in
 * that case would calculate the required width of the rows in an
 * idle or timeout source (see g_timeout_add()) and when the widget
 * is requested its actual width in #GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_width()
 * it can simply consult the width accumulated so far in the
 * #GtkCellAreaContext object.
 *
 * A simple example where rows are rendered from top to bottom and
 * take up the full width of the layouting widget would look like:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * static void
 * foo_get_preferred_width (GtkWidget       *widget,
 *                          gint            *minimum_size,
 *                          gint            *natural_size)
 * {
 *   Foo        *foo  = FOO (widget);
 *   FooPrivate *priv = foo->priv;
 *
 *   foo_ensure_at_least_one_handfull_of_rows_have_been_requested (foo);
 *
 *   gtk_cell_area_context_get_preferred_width (priv->context, minimum_size, natural_size);
 * }
 * ]|
 *
 * In the above example the Foo widget has to make sure that some
 * row sizes have been calculated (the amount of rows that Foo judged
 * was appropriate to request space for in a single timeout iteration)
 * before simply returning the amount of space required by the area via
 * the #GtkCellAreaContext.
 *
 * Requesting the height for width (or width for height) of an area is
 * a similar task except in this case the #GtkCellAreaContext does not
 * store the data (actually, it does not know how much space the layouting
 * widget plans to allocate it for every row. It’s up to the layouting
 * widget to render each row of data with the appropriate height and
 * width which was requested by the #GtkCellArea).
 *
 * In order to request the height for width of all the rows at the
 * root level of a #GtkTreeModel one would do the following:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * GtkTreeIter iter;
 * gint        minimum_height;
 * gint        natural_height;
 * gint        full_minimum_height = 0;
 * gint        full_natural_height = 0;
 *
 * valid = gtk_tree_model_get_iter_first (model, &iter);
 * while (valid)
 *   {
 *     gtk_cell_area_apply_attributes (area, model, &iter, FALSE, FALSE);
 *     gtk_cell_area_get_preferred_height_for_width (area, context, widget,
 *                                                   width, &minimum_height, &natural_height);
 *
 *     if (width_is_for_allocation)
 *        cache_row_height (&iter, minimum_height, natural_height);
 *
 *     full_minimum_height += minimum_height;
 *     full_natural_height += natural_height;
 *
 *     valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (model, &iter);
 *   }
 * ]|
 *
 * Note that in the above example we would need to cache the heights
 * returned for each row so that we would know what sizes to render the
 * areas for each row. However we would only want to really cache the
 * heights if the request is intended for the layouting widgets real
 * allocation.
 *
 * In some cases the layouting widget is requested the height for an
 * arbitrary for_width, this is a special case for layouting widgets
 * who need to request size for tens of thousands  of rows. For this
 * case it’s only important that the layouting widget calculate
 * one reasonably sized chunk of rows and return that height
 * synchronously. The reasoning here is that any layouting widget is
 * at least capable of synchronously calculating enough height to fill
 * the screen height (or scrolled window height) in response to a single
 * call to #GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_height_for_width(). Returning
 * a perfect height for width that is larger than the screen area is
 * inconsequential since after the layouting receives an allocation
 * from a scrolled window it simply continues to drive the scrollbar
 * values while more and more height is required for the row heights
 * that are calculated in the background.
 *
 * # Rendering Areas
 *
 * Once area sizes have been aquired at least for the rows in the
 * visible area of the layouting widget they can be rendered at
 * #GtkWidgetClass.draw() time.
 *
 * A crude example of how to render all the rows at the root level
 * runs as follows:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * GtkAllocation allocation;
 * GdkRectangle  cell_area = { 0, };
 * GtkTreeIter   iter;
 * gint          minimum_width;
 * gint          natural_width;
 *
 * gtk_widget_get_allocation (widget, &allocation);
 * cell_area.width = allocation.width;
 *
 * valid = gtk_tree_model_get_iter_first (model, &iter);
 * while (valid)
 *   {
 *     cell_area.height = get_cached_height_for_row (&iter);
 *
 *     gtk_cell_area_apply_attributes (area, model, &iter, FALSE, FALSE);
 *     gtk_cell_area_render (area, context, widget, cr,
 *                           &cell_area, &cell_area, state_flags, FALSE);
 *
 *     cell_area.y += cell_area.height;
 *
 *     valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (model, &iter);
 *   }
 * ]|
 *
 * Note that the cached height in this example really depends on how
 * the layouting widget works. The layouting widget might decide to
 * give every row its minimum or natural height or, if the model content
 * is expected to fit inside the layouting widget without scrolling, it
 * would make sense to calculate the allocation for each row at
 * #GtkWidget::size-allocate time using gtk_distribute_natural_allocation().
 *
 * # Handling Events and Driving Keyboard Focus
 *
 * Passing events to the area is as simple as handling events on any
 * normal widget and then passing them to the gtk_cell_area_event()
 * API as they come in. Usually #GtkCellArea is only interested in
 * button events, however some customized derived areas can be implemented
 * who are interested in handling other events. Handling an event can
 * trigger the #GtkCellArea::focus-changed signal to fire; as well as
 * #GtkCellArea::add-editable in the case that an editable cell was
 * clicked and needs to start editing. You can call
 * gtk_cell_area_stop_editing() at any time to cancel any cell editing
 * that is currently in progress.
 *
 * The #GtkCellArea drives keyboard focus from cell to cell in a way
 * similar to #GtkWidget. For layouting widgets that support giving
 * focus to cells it’s important to remember to pass %GTK_CELL_RENDERER_FOCUSED
 * to the area functions for the row that has focus and to tell the
 * area to paint the focus at render time.
 *
 * Layouting widgets that accept focus on cells should implement the
 * #GtkWidgetClass.focus() virtual method. The layouting widget is always
 * responsible for knowing where #GtkTreeModel rows are rendered inside
 * the widget, so at #GtkWidgetClass.focus() time the layouting widget
 * should use the #GtkCellArea methods to navigate focus inside the area
 * and then observe the GtkDirectionType to pass the focus to adjacent
 * rows and areas.
 *
 * A basic example of how the #GtkWidgetClass.focus() virtual method
 * should be implemented:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * static gboolean
 * foo_focus (GtkWidget       *widget,
 *            GtkDirectionType direction)
 * {
 *   Foo        *foo  = FOO (widget);
 *   FooPrivate *priv = foo->priv;
 *   gint        focus_row;
 *   gboolean    have_focus = FALSE;
 *
 *   focus_row = priv->focus_row;
 *
 *   if (!gtk_widget_has_focus (widget))
 *     gtk_widget_grab_focus (widget);
 *
 *   valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (priv->model, &iter, NULL, priv->focus_row);
 *   while (valid)
 *     {
 *       gtk_cell_area_apply_attributes (priv->area, priv->model, &iter, FALSE, FALSE);
 *
 *       if (gtk_cell_area_focus (priv->area, direction))
 *         {
 *            priv->focus_row = focus_row;
 *            have_focus = TRUE;
 *            break;
 *         }
 *       else
 *         {
 *           if (direction == GTK_DIR_RIGHT ||
 *               direction == GTK_DIR_LEFT)
 *             break;
 *           else if (direction == GTK_DIR_UP ||
 *                    direction == GTK_DIR_TAB_BACKWARD)
 *            {
 *               if (focus_row == 0)
 *                 break;
 *               else
 *                {
 *                   focus_row--;
 *                   valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (priv->model, &iter, NULL, focus_row);
 *                }
 *             }
 *           else
 *             {
 *               if (focus_row == last_row)
 *                 break;
 *               else
 *                 {
 *                   focus_row++;
 *                   valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (priv->model, &iter);
 *                 }
 *             }
 *         }
 *     }
 *     return have_focus;
 * }
 * ]|
 *
 * Note that the layouting widget is responsible for matching the
 * GtkDirectionType values to the way it lays out its cells.
 *
 * # Cell Properties
 *
 * The #GtkCellArea introduces cell properties for #GtkCellRenderers
 * in very much the same way that #GtkContainer introduces
 * [child properties][child-properties]
 * for #GtkWidgets. This provides some general interfaces for defining
 * the relationship cell areas have with their cells. For instance in a
 * #GtkCellAreaBox a cell might “expand” and receive extra space when
 * the area is allocated more than its full natural request, or a cell
 * might be configured to “align” with adjacent rows which were requested
 * and rendered with the same #GtkCellAreaContext.
 *
 * Use gtk_cell_area_class_install_cell_property() to install cell
 * properties for a cell area class and gtk_cell_area_class_find_cell_property()
 * or gtk_cell_area_class_list_cell_properties() to get information about
 * existing cell properties.
 *
 * To set the value of a cell property, use gtk_cell_area_cell_set_property(),
 * gtk_cell_area_cell_set() or gtk_cell_area_cell_set_valist(). To obtain
 * the value of a cell property, use gtk_cell_area_cell_get_property(),
 * gtk_cell_area_cell_get() or gtk_cell_area_cell_get_valist().
