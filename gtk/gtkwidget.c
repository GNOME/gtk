/**
 * GtkWidget:
 *
 * The base class for all widgets.
 *
 * `GtkWidget` is the base class all widgets in GTK derive from. It manages the
 * widget lifecycle, layout, states and style.
 *
 * ### Height-for-width Geometry Management
 *
 * GTK uses a height-for-width (and width-for-height) geometry management
 * system. Height-for-width means that a widget can change how much
 * vertical space it needs, depending on the amount of horizontal space
 * that it is given (and similar for width-for-height). The most common
 * example is a label that reflows to fill up the available width, wraps
 * to fewer lines, and therefore needs less height.
 *
 * Height-for-width geometry management is implemented in GTK by way
 * of two virtual methods:
 *
 * - [vfunc@Gtk.Widget.get_request_mode]
 * - [vfunc@Gtk.Widget.measure]
 *
 * There are some important things to keep in mind when implementing
 * height-for-width and when using it in widget implementations.
 *
 * If you implement a direct `GtkWidget` subclass that supports
 * height-for-width or width-for-height geometry management for itself
 * or its child widgets, the [vfunc@Gtk.Widget.get_request_mode] virtual
 * function must be implemented as well and return the widget's preferred
 * request mode. The default implementation of this virtual function
 * returns %GTK_SIZE_REQUEST_CONSTANT_SIZE, which means that the widget will
 * only ever get -1 passed as the for_size value to its
 * [vfunc@Gtk.Widget.measure] implementation.
 *
 * The geometry management system will query a widget hierarchy in
 * only one orientation at a time. When widgets are initially queried
 * for their minimum sizes it is generally done in two initial passes
 * in the [enum@Gtk.SizeRequestMode] chosen by the toplevel.
 *
 * For example, when queried in the normal %GTK_SIZE_REQUEST_HEIGHT_FOR_WIDTH mode:
 *
 * First, the default minimum and natural width for each widget
 * in the interface will be computed using [method@Gtk.Widget.measure] with an
 * orientation of %GTK_ORIENTATION_HORIZONTAL and a for_size of -1.
 * Because the preferred widths for each widget depend on the preferred
 * widths of their children, this information propagates up the hierarchy,
 * and finally a minimum and natural width is determined for the entire
 * toplevel. Next, the toplevel will use the minimum width to query for the
 * minimum height contextual to that width using [method@Gtk.Widget.measure] with an
 * orientation of %GTK_ORIENTATION_VERTICAL and a for_size of the just computed
 * width. This will also be a highly recursive operation. The minimum height
 * for the minimum width is normally used to set the minimum size constraint
 * on the toplevel.
 *
 * After the toplevel window has initially requested its size in both
 * dimensions it can go on to allocate itself a reasonable size (or a size
 * previously specified with [method@Gtk.Window.set_default_size]). During the
 * recursive allocation process it’s important to note that request cycles
 * will be recursively executed while widgets allocate their children.
 * Each widget, once allocated a size, will go on to first share the
 * space in one orientation among its children and then request each child's
 * height for its target allocated width or its width for allocated height,
 * depending. In this way a `GtkWidget` will typically be requested its size
 * a number of times before actually being allocated a size. The size a
 * widget is finally allocated can of course differ from the size it has
 * requested. For this reason, `GtkWidget` caches a  small number of results
 * to avoid re-querying for the same sizes in one allocation cycle.
 *
 * If a widget does move content around to intelligently use up the
 * allocated size then it must support the request in both
 * `GtkSizeRequestMode`s even if the widget in question only
 * trades sizes in a single orientation.
 *
 * For instance, a [class@Gtk.Label] that does height-for-width word wrapping
 * will not expect to have [vfunc@Gtk.Widget.measure] with an orientation of
 * %GTK_ORIENTATION_VERTICAL called because that call is specific to a
 * width-for-height request. In this case the label must return the height
 * required for its own minimum possible width. By following this rule any
 * widget that handles height-for-width or width-for-height requests will
 * always be allocated at least enough space to fit its own content.
 *
 * Here are some examples of how a %GTK_SIZE_REQUEST_HEIGHT_FOR_WIDTH widget
 * generally deals with width-for-height requests:
 *
 * ```c
 * static void
 * foo_widget_measure (GtkWidget      *widget,
 *                     GtkOrientation  orientation,
 *                     int             for_size,
 *                     int            *minimum_size,
 *                     int            *natural_size,
 *                     int            *minimum_baseline,
 *                     int            *natural_baseline)
 * {
 *   if (orientation == GTK_ORIENTATION_HORIZONTAL)
 *     {
 *       // Calculate minimum and natural width
 *     }
 *   else // VERTICAL
 *     {
 *       if (i_am_in_height_for_width_mode)
 *         {
 *           int min_width, dummy;
 *
 *           // First, get the minimum width of our widget
 *           GTK_WIDGET_GET_CLASS (widget)->measure (widget, GTK_ORIENTATION_HORIZONTAL, -1,
 *                                                   &min_width, &dummy, &dummy, &dummy);
 *
 *           // Now use the minimum width to retrieve the minimum and natural height to display
 *           // that width.
 *           GTK_WIDGET_GET_CLASS (widget)->measure (widget, GTK_ORIENTATION_VERTICAL, min_width,
 *                                                   minimum_size, natural_size, &dummy, &dummy);
 *         }
 *       else
 *         {
 *           // ... some widgets do both.
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Often a widget needs to get its own request during size request or
 * allocation. For example, when computing height it may need to also
 * compute width. Or when deciding how to use an allocation, the widget
 * may need to know its natural size. In these cases, the widget should
 * be careful to call its virtual methods directly, like in the code
 * example above.
 *
 * It will not work to use the wrapper function [method@Gtk.Widget.measure]
 * inside your own [vfunc@Gtk.Widget.size_allocate] implementation.
 * These return a request adjusted by [class@Gtk.SizeGroup], the widget's
 * align and expand flags, as well as its CSS style.
 *
 * If a widget used the wrappers inside its virtual method implementations,
 * then the adjustments (such as widget margins) would be applied
 * twice. GTK therefore does not allow this and will warn if you try
 * to do it.
 *
 * Of course if you are getting the size request for another widget, such
 * as a child widget, you must use [method@Gtk.Widget.measure]; otherwise, you
 * would not properly consider widget margins, [class@Gtk.SizeGroup], and
 * so forth.
 *
 * GTK also supports baseline vertical alignment of widgets. This
 * means that widgets are positioned such that the typographical baseline of
 * widgets in the same row are aligned. This happens if a widget supports
 * baselines, has a vertical alignment using baselines, and is inside
 * a widget that supports baselines and has a natural “row” that it aligns to
 * the baseline, or a baseline assigned to it by the grandparent.
 *
 * Baseline alignment support for a widget is also done by the
 * [vfunc@Gtk.Widget.measure] virtual function. It allows you to report
 * both a minimum and natural size.
 *
 * If a widget ends up baseline aligned it will be allocated all the space in
 * the parent as if it was %GTK_ALIGN_FILL, but the selected baseline can be
 * found via [method@Gtk.Widget.get_baseline]. If the baseline has a
 * value other than -1 you need to align the widget such that the baseline
 * appears at the position.
 *
 * ### GtkWidget as GtkBuildable
 *
 * The `GtkWidget` implementation of the `GtkBuildable` interface
 * supports various custom elements to specify additional aspects of widgets
 * that are not directly expressed as properties.
 *
 * If the widget uses a [class@Gtk.LayoutManager], `GtkWidget` supports
 * a custom `<layout>` element, used to define layout properties:
 *
 * ```xml
 * <object class="GtkGrid" id="my_grid">
 *   <child>
 *     <object class="GtkLabel" id="label1">
 *       <property name="label">Description</property>
 *       <layout>
 *         <property name="column">0</property>
 *         <property name="row">0</property>
 *         <property name="row-span">1</property>
 *         <property name="column-span">1</property>
 *       </layout>
 *     </object>
 *   </child>
 *   <child>
 *     <object class="GtkEntry" id="description_entry">
 *       <layout>
 *         <property name="column">1</property>
 *         <property name="row">0</property>
 *         <property name="row-span">1</property>
 *         <property name="column-span">1</property>
 *       </layout>
 *     </object>
 *   </child>
 * </object>
 * ```
 *
 * `GtkWidget` allows style information such as style classes to
 * be associated with widgets, using the custom `<style>` element:
 *
 * ```xml
 * <object class="GtkButton" id="button1">
 *   <style>
 *     <class name="my-special-button-class"/>
 *     <class name="dark-button"/>
 *   </style>
 * </object>
 * ```
 *
 * `GtkWidget` allows defining accessibility information, such as properties,
 * relations, and states, using the custom `<accessibility>` element:
 *
 * ```xml
 * <object class="GtkButton" id="button1">
 *   <accessibility>
 *     <property name="label">Download</property>
 *     <relation name="labelled-by">label1</relation>
 *   </accessibility>
 * </object>
 * ```
 *
 * ### Building composite widgets from template XML
 *
 * `GtkWidget `exposes some facilities to automate the procedure
 * of creating composite widgets using "templates".
 *
 * To create composite widgets with `GtkBuilder` XML, one must associate
 * the interface description with the widget class at class initialization
 * time using [method@Gtk.WidgetClass.set_template].
 *
 * The interface description semantics expected in composite template descriptions
 * is slightly different from regular [class@Gtk.Builder] XML.
 *
 * Unlike regular interface descriptions, [method@Gtk.WidgetClass.set_template]
 * will expect a `<template>` tag as a direct child of the toplevel
 * `<interface>` tag. The `<template>` tag must specify the “class” attribute
 * which must be the type name of the widget. Optionally, the “parent”
 * attribute may be specified to specify the direct parent type of the widget
 * type; this is ignored by `GtkBuilder` but can be used by UI design tools to
 * introspect what kind of properties and internal children exist for a given
 * type when the actual type does not exist.
 *
 * The XML which is contained inside the `<template>` tag behaves as if it were
 * added to the `<object>` tag defining the widget itself. You may set properties
 * on a widget by inserting `<property>` tags into the `<template>` tag, and also
 * add `<child>` tags to add children and extend a widget in the normal way you
 * would with `<object>` tags.
 *
 * Additionally, `<object>` tags can also be added before and after the initial
 * `<template>` tag in the normal way, allowing one to define auxiliary objects
 * which might be referenced by other widgets declared as children of the
 * `<template>` tag.
 *
 * Since, unlike the `<object>` tag, the `<template>` tag does not contain an
 * “id” attribute, if you need to refer to the instance of the object itself that
 * the template will create, simply refer to the template class name in an
 * applicable element content.
 *
 * Here is an example of a template definition, which includes an example of
 * this in the `<signal>` tag:
 *
 * ```xml
 * <interface>
 *   <template class="FooWidget" parent="GtkBox">
 *     <property name="orientation">horizontal</property>
 *     <property name="spacing">4</property>
 *     <child>
 *       <object class="GtkButton" id="hello_button">
 *         <property name="label">Hello World</property>
 *         <signal name="clicked" handler="hello_button_clicked" object="FooWidget" swapped="yes"/>
 *       </object>
 *     </child>
 *     <child>
 *       <object class="GtkButton" id="goodbye_button">
 *         <property name="label">Goodbye World</property>
 *       </object>
 *     </child>
 *   </template>
 * </interface>
 * ```
 *
 * Typically, you'll place the template fragment into a file that is
 * bundled with your project, using `GResource`. In order to load the
 * template, you need to call [method@Gtk.WidgetClass.set_template_from_resource]
 * from the class initialization of your `GtkWidget` type:
 *
 * ```c
 * static void
 * foo_widget_class_init (FooWidgetClass *klass)
 * {
 *   // ...
 *
 *   gtk_widget_class_set_template_from_resource (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),
 *                                                "/com/example/ui/foowidget.ui");
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * You will also need to call [method@Gtk.Widget.init_template] from the
 * instance initialization function:
 *
 * ```c
 * static void
 * foo_widget_init (FooWidget *self)
 * {
 *   gtk_widget_init_template (GTK_WIDGET (self));
 *
 *   // Initialize the rest of the widget...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * as well as calling [method@Gtk.Widget.dispose_template] from the dispose
 * function:
 *
 * ```c
 * static void
 * foo_widget_dispose (GObject *gobject)
 * {
 *   FooWidget *self = FOO_WIDGET (gobject);
 *
 *   // Dispose objects for which you have a reference...
 *
 *   // Clear the template children for this widget type
 *   gtk_widget_dispose_template (GTK_WIDGET (self), FOO_TYPE_WIDGET);
 *
 *   G_OBJECT_CLASS (foo_widget_parent_class)->dispose (gobject);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * You can access widgets defined in the template using the
 * [method@Gtk.Widget.get_template_child] function, but you will typically declare
 * a pointer in the instance private data structure of your type using the same
 * name as the widget in the template definition, and call
 * [method@Gtk.WidgetClass.bind_template_child_full] (or one of its wrapper macros
 * [func@Gtk.widget_class_bind_template_child] and [func@Gtk.widget_class_bind_template_child_private])
 * with that name, e.g.
 *
 * ```c
 * typedef struct {
 *   GtkWidget *hello_button;
 *   GtkWidget *goodbye_button;
 * } FooWidgetPrivate;
 *
 * G_DEFINE_TYPE_WITH_PRIVATE (FooWidget, foo_widget, GTK_TYPE_BOX)
 *
 * static void
 * foo_widget_dispose (GObject *gobject)
 * {
 *   gtk_widget_dispose_template (GTK_WIDGET (gobject), FOO_TYPE_WIDGET);
 *
 *   G_OBJECT_CLASS (foo_widget_parent_class)->dispose (gobject);
 * }
 *
 * static void
 * foo_widget_class_init (FooWidgetClass *klass)
 * {
 *   // ...
 *   G_OBJECT_CLASS (klass)->dispose = foo_widget_dispose;
 *
 *   gtk_widget_class_set_template_from_resource (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),
 *                                                "/com/example/ui/foowidget.ui");
 *   gtk_widget_class_bind_template_child_private (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),
 *                                                 FooWidget, hello_button);
 *   gtk_widget_class_bind_template_child_private (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),
 *                                                 FooWidget, goodbye_button);
 * }
 *
 * static void
 * foo_widget_init (FooWidget *widget)
 * {
 *   gtk_widget_init_template (GTK_WIDGET (widget));
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * You can also use [method@Gtk.WidgetClass.bind_template_callback_full] (or
 * is wrapper macro [func@Gtk.widget_class_bind_template_callback]) to connect
 * a signal callback defined in the template with a function visible in the
 * scope of the class, e.g.
 *
 * ```c
 * // the signal handler has the instance and user data swapped
 * // because of the swapped="yes" attribute in the template XML
 * static void
 * hello_button_clicked (FooWidget *self,
 *                       GtkButton *button)
 * {
 *   g_print ("Hello, world!\n");
 * }
 *
 * static void
 * foo_widget_class_init (FooWidgetClass *klass)
 * {
 *   // ...
 *   gtk_widget_class_set_template_from_resource (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),
 *                                                "/com/example/ui/foowidget.ui");
 *   gtk_widget_class_bind_template_callback (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass), hello_button_clicked);
 * }
 * ```

 * @user_data: data to pass to @callback
 * @notify: function to call to free @user_data when the callback is removed.
 *
 * Queues an animation frame update and adds a callback to be called
 * before each frame.
 *
 * Until the tick callback is removed, it will be called frequently
 * (usually at the frame rate of the output device or as quickly as
 * the application can be repainted, whichever is slower). For this
 * reason, is most suitable for handling graphics that change every
 * frame or every few frames. The tick callback does not automatically
 * imply a relayout or repaint. If you want a repaint or relayout, and
 * aren’t changing widget properties that would trigger that (for example,
 * changing the text of a `GtkLabel`), then you will have to call
 * [method@Gtk.Widget.queue_resize] or [method@Gtk.Widget.queue_draw]
 * yourself.
 *
 * [method@Gdk.FrameClock.get_frame_time] should generally be used
 * for timing continuous animations and
 * [method@Gdk.FrameTimings.get_predicted_presentation_time] if you are
 * trying to display isolated frames at particular times.
 *
 * This is a more convenient alternative to connecting directly to the
 * [signal@Gdk.FrameClock::update] signal of `GdkFrameClock`, since you
 * don't have to worry about when a `GdkFrameClock` is assigned to a widget.
 *
 * Returns: an id for the connection of this callback. Remove the callback
 *   by passing the id returned from this function to
 *   [method@Gtk.Widget.remove_tick_callback]

 * to get a time to use for animating. For example you might record

 * by calling [method@Gdk.FrameClock.get_frame_time] again during each repaint.
 *
 * [method@Gdk.FrameClock.request_phase] will result in a new frame on the
 * clock, but won’t necessarily repaint any widgets. To repaint a
 * widget, you have to use [method@Gtk.Widget.queue_draw] which invalidates
 * the widget (thus scheduling it to receive a draw on the next
 * frame). gtk_widget_queue_draw() will also end up requesting a frame
 * on the appropriate frame clock.
 *
 * A widget’s frame clock will not change while the widget is
 * mapped. Reparenting a widget (which implies a temporary unmap) can
 * change the widget’s frame clock.

 * appear translucent, since it is ultimatively rendered on that
 * toplevel. The opacity value itself is not inherited by child
 * widgets (since that would make widgets deeper in the hierarchy
 * progressively more translucent). As a consequence, [class@Gtk.Popover]s

 *  - when calling `g_object_new()` on a widget with composite templates,

 *    take precedence over properties set in the private template XML
 *
