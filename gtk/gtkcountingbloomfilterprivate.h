 * @Title: GtkCountingBloomFilter
 * @See_also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter,
 *            https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_Bloom_filter
 *
 * This implements a counting bloom filter. A bloom filter is a space-efficient
 * probabilistic data structure that is used to test whether an element may be
 * a member of a set.  
 * The Wikipedia links provide a lot more details into how and why this data
 * structure works and when to use it.
 *
 * This implementation is based on similar implementations in web browsers, because it's
 * original use case is the same: Making CSS lookups fast.
 *
 * As such, the number of bits is hardcoded to 12 and the elements in the set
 * are 16bit hash values.  
 * It is possible to use 32bit hash values or a different number of bits, should this
 * be considered useful.
