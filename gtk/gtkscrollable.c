/**
 * SECTION:gtkscrollable
 * @Short_Description: An interface for scrollable widgets
 * @Title: GtkScrollable
 *
 * #GtkScrollable is an interface that is implemented by widgets with native
 * scrolling ability.
 *
 * To implement this interface you should override the
 * #GtkScrollable:hadjustment and #GtkScrollable:vadjustment properties.
 *
 * ## Creating a scrollable widget
 *
 * All scrollable widgets should do the following.
 *
 * - When a parent widget sets the scrollable child widget’s adjustments,
 *   the widget should populate the adjustments’
 *   #GtkAdjustment:lower, #GtkAdjustment:upper,
 *   #GtkAdjustment:step-increment, #GtkAdjustment:page-increment and
 *   #GtkAdjustment:page-size properties and connect to the
 *   #GtkAdjustment::value-changed signal.
 *
 * - Because its preferred size is the size for a fully expanded widget,
 *   the scrollable widget must be able to cope with underallocations.
 *   This means that it must accept any value passed to its
 *   #GtkWidgetClass.size_allocate() function.
 *
 * - When the parent allocates space to the scrollable child widget,
 *   the widget should update the adjustments’ properties with new values.
 *
 * - When any of the adjustments emits the #GtkAdjustment::value-changed signal,
 *   the scrollable widget should scroll its contents.
