 * @Short_description: Root widgets
 * @See_also: #GtkWindow
 *
 * #GtkRoot is the interface implemented by all widgets that can act as a toplevel
 * widget to a hierarchy of widgets. The root widget takes care of providing the
 * connection to the windowing system and manages layout, drawing and event delivery
 * for its widget hierarchy.
 *
 * The obvious example of a #GtkRoot is #GtkWindow.
